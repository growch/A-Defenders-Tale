But that had been months ago, before [pronoun1]’d heard of this cursed realm. Or its ruler, Prince Nero. Sun hoarder. Light slayer. Harbinger of night. His name mattered little. [defender] would stop him, or perish trying. 

[Pronoun1] now stood at the crossroads leading to [pronoun3] final destination on the continent—a small coastal town, important only for its docks, and the ship [pronoun1] hoped would take [pronoun2] across the Stormy Sea to the Barrier Isles. [pronoun1]’d heard rumors that Prince Nero had hidden on a secret island that floated through the center of the Isles. It was concealed by darkness and its ever-changing location would make it difficult to track.]]>

And so [pronoun1] made [pronoun3] way toward the docks, the [wardrobe2] the wind that slid down the dusty road. [Pronoun1] avoided the town’s center and hum of humanity, such that it was, intent on [pronoun3] destination. [Pronoun1]’d had few moments of peace since [pronoun1]’d begun [pronoun3] quest, and [pronoun1] couldn’t help but think back, still harboring some sense of disbelief, despite the circumstances.

[Pronoun3] friend, [contact], had dared [pronoun2] to submit an application. [defender] had never been one to back down from a challenge, and [pronoun1]’d never expected to be selected—it was unheard of when you considered the number of candidates. [Pronoun1] wondered what [contact] had thought when [contactPronoun1] heard [defender] had been given the title. [defender] hadn’t been given a chance to tell [contactPronoun2], or anyone for that matter, goodbye.]]>

			<![CDATA[to the day, on [date]. [Pronoun1]’d been in this place ever since, and had made it to the town by some combination of dumb luck, determination, and driving fear. [Pronoun1]’d avoided the monsters and night things that had hunted [pronoun2] with the same wariness [pronoun1] now avoided the townspeople. No one could be trusted. [Pronoun1] knew that from a growing collection of dismal experiences.

As [pronoun1] ghosted through the streets, [pronoun1] took in the small details of decay: the flower boxes, now gnarled graveyards. The shuttered, sagging buildings. The cobblestones steeped in the endless night’s chill. And everywhere, shadows, darkness, the taste of dust. The sun had drifted from the continent three months earlier when the previous Defender, [previousDefender], had gone missing. The evidence was apparent in every place [pronoun1]’d passed.]]>

			<![CDATA[Not for the first time, [defender] wondered if [pronoun3] predecessor had simply abandoned [previousDefenderPronoun3] quest, finally giving up against Nero’s growing power. [Pronoun1] shook [pronoun3] head, dispelling the terrible thought. The previous Defender had pledged the same oath as [pronoun1]: to defend the realm at all costs. Where [pronoun3] predecessor had failed, [pronoun1] would succeed. For [defender] possessed two things that set [pronoun2] apart: [instrument1] [companion1]

But in the meantime, [defender] had somewhere to be, and time was running out. [Pronoun1] quickened [pronoun3] pace, almost tripping over a man sitting on the road, just outside the range of a nearby lantern’s glow.
			
“Alms for the poor,” he murmured, peering up at [defender] from under a dirty cap. 

[defender] paused. [Pronoun1] had little money, and less time. The docks would be around the next bend; [pronoun1] could already hear the sound of the ocean. But [pronoun1] hated to see anyone in trouble, and the man looked frail. And hungry.]]>

The man nodded. “The very same. There was a time when the prince was our champion, keeping us safe from harm. But Nero had an insatiable curiosity, and the more he learned, the more he wanted to know. Many of the royals dabbled in wizardry, but the prince…” The man rubbed his hands together, warming to his story. “Ahhh, the prince was a special case. Always wanting to know more. People tell many tales of why he began to eat the sunlight, but I know the truth.” The old man patted the ground beside him. “For another coin, I’ll tell you what I know.”

			<![CDATA[“A wise decision,” the old man said, snatching the coin from his cup. It disappeared into the folds of his clothing as he cleared his throat. 

“What happened is this,” he began. "The prince had filled his head with so much knowledge that it crowded out his ability to sleep. It’s no secret he suffered terrible fits of insomnia. Shamans and sages flocked to heal him. Had they succeeded, the story might have ended, but Nero’s insomnia was unstoppable. After a particularly harrowing week of sleeplessness, the prince had an idea. If he could dim the morning sunlight, he might be able to get the sleep he craved. It was then that he stumbled upon an ancient sun-sucking spell.

“Scholars have debated the truth,” the man continued, “but the prince was once a good lad. He would never have consumed the realm’s sunlight if he’d known the consequences. I believe he simply planned to dim the light for a few days to catch up on sleep. But then, we both know that is not what happened.” 

[defender] nodded. “Intent is honorable,” [pronoun1] said,]]>

			<![CDATA[“’Tis true,” the man agreed. “Once Nero had a taste of sunlight, he changed. His days of insomnia were over, for he no longer needed sleep. He maintained perfect clarity of thought. His senses were enhanced. For a time, the realm thrived under his newfound power, but eventually his gift became a curse. He began to suck the realm dry. Until the previous Defender—Defender [previousDefender]—arrived.”

The old man paused, halted by a coughing fit.]]>

			<![CDATA[[defender] nodded. Everything [pronoun1]’d learned on [pronoun3] travels pointed to finding the prince near the Isles, and [pronoun1] was pleased to hear another report of it. “How did [previousDefender] track the prince?” [pronoun1] asked.

“[PreviousDefenderPronoun1] was the Defender,” the man replied, as if this was answer enough.

“Naturally,” [defender] said, wishing that a title could actually bestow the skills that went with it. 

“No one knows what [previousDefender] said to the prince,” the man continued, “but for a time, Nero confined his light consumption to his own estates. When these were exhausted, he moved on to the sparsely populated regions. The tundras. The wastelands. The arctic poles. But his thirst was unquenchable, and when these places were drained, he continued on to the remaining lands. Which is when Defender [previousDefender] gathered the leaders of the Barrier Isles: Alphonse, the Catling Vizier; Snowmonch, the snow serpent; Maysel, the sand wizard; and Morrissey, the water god. [PreviousDefenderPronoun1] knew together they could take back the realm.”

“What happened?” [defender] asked, hoping to learn from [pronoun3] predecessor’s story. These were the same leaders [pronoun1] would seek after crossing the Stormy Sea. 

The man shrugged. “The Defender held [previousDefenderPronoun3] summit. The leaders gathered. What happened next is a mystery. The light continues to shine over the Barrier Isles, and Defender]]>

As the figure rose, [pronoun1] realized it was a tiny woman. She barely reached the top of [defender]’s shoulders. Bleached, cropped hair stuck up in disorderly clumps around the woman’s head complimented by a striped vest and matching breaches. A silver bandana shimmered around her neck. 

“I would recognize that [wardrobeShort] and [weapon] anywhere,” the woman said. “Tales of your daring proceed you—you’re the Defender of the Realm.” She eyed the [weapon] clenched in [defender]’s hand. “There’ll be no need for that, Defender.

[defender] hung [pronoun3] head sheepishly. [Pronoun1]’d become too accustomed to acting without thinking, and [pronoun1] now recognized the error of [pronoun3] ways. [Pronoun1] marched over to the tornado and waved [pronoun3] quill’s feather toward the whirling illustration. It collapsed, staining the docks with ink. The captain stood in the center of the stain, looking perfectly composed.

“Captain,” [defender] said, “please accept my humble apology. I made a grievous error in judgment, I beg your pardon.”

“No harm done,” she replied, grinning. “Now what was it you wanted from me?”]]></weapon>

“But of course,” the ostrich agreed, nodding in the Captain’s direction. “Captain Cleapeezious Sandowskly,” she began, pausing to adjust a tail feather that had been blown askew by the tornado, “has been instrumental in the protection of this realm for over a decade, and has, in my humble opinion, been a primary hurdle in Prince Nero’s quest for power.

[defender] unfastened Noah’s tank from its place on [pronoun3] hip and brought it up to eye level so [pronoun1] could see the little fish clearly. 

“Check your chest,” Cleapeezious called from the tornado.

“Quite right, quite right,” the fish replied, swimming down to the treasure chest he used to collect his memories. After a moment he dislodged a slip of paper. “By jove, now I remember. The Cap’n saved me from three sea beasties over the last few years. More importantly, she bested the mad prince’s sea fleet. She’s a true friend of the realm, or my name’s not Noah.”]]></companion>

[defender] rose to [pronoun3] full height, giving Captain Cleapeezious Sandowskly a menacing look. “As Defender of the Realm,” [pronoun1] announced, “I shall be commandeering your boat.”

			<![CDATA[[defender] had long ago learned that if all else failed, a well-placed (yet truthful) compliment could work wonders when beginning a negotiation. [Pronoun1] motioned toward the captain’s boat. “A fine sailing vessel,” [pronoun1] began. “The Stormin’ Norman is a lovely name. It reminds me of springtime. Showers on a sunny day. Walks in the park.”

A smile stretched over the captain’s face. “Springtime and walks in the park, is it?” she repeated, laughter rippling over her thin frame. The captain looked [defender] over and seemed to reach a verdict. “I see the realm’s got itself a silver-tongued Defender.” 

[defender] felt a smile ghosting over [pronoun3] face in response. The first smile, [pronoun1] realized, in months. As the captain’s laughter died down again, [defender] held out [pronoun3] hand. “Please call me [defender],” [pronoun1] said. “I’d like to book passage to the Barrier Isles.”

The captain reached out and, pumping [defender]’s hand up and down. “[defender],” she said, drawing the word out like a song. “A nice name. Strong. A Defender’s name.” She took a step back, her eyes sweeping over [defender]’s faded [wardrobeShort] and unwashed, [hair] hair. Her gaze paused at [defender]’s battered travel pack. “But the crossing to the Barrier Isles is not one I make lightly. What leads you there?”

[defender] hoped [pronoun1] had made the right decision by trusting the captain. “I must speak to the leaders of the Barrier Isles,” [pronoun1] explained. “With their aid, I hope to stop Prince Nero.”

Cleepeazious mulled her words over. “Do you have coin to pay?”

[coins]

The captain scratched her head in thought, pushing her white hair into further disarray, before shaking her head sadly. “A pittance is what you’re offering, [genderSpoken].”

[defender] felt the last vestiges of hope seep from [pronoun3] body. [Pronoun1]’d navigated the endless night of the realm. [Pronoun1]’d avoided the monsters that had chased [pronoun2] through it. [Pronoun1]’d done it alone, if you didn’t count [companion1]

The ocean was the only obstacle [pronoun1] couldn’t pass—not without help. “Please,” [pronoun1] said. “I must cross. The future of the realm depends on it.”

The captain shook her head again, this time more decisively. “I support your quest, Defender. But I don’t work on charity. The coastal waters are treacherous since the darkness settled the continent.”

“Well, now,” the captain said, ]]>

Without further ado, Captain Cleapeezious Sandowskly climbed the ladder along the side of the boat and was swallowed by the darkness. [defender] hesitated. [Pronoun1] was anxious to begin [pronoun3] quest, but the idea of fresh food was tempting.]]>

The man scratched his thinning hair as he looked back at the other townspeople gathered around the table. [defender]’s words, rather than soothing them, had for some reason elicited the opposite response. People stood from their tables, some grasping the knives they’d used for dinner. 

“Last time a stranger came through here, he robbed me lanterns right off the porch,” a woman yelled. 

“Tha’s right!” another woman replied. “A thief for the Light Slayer, no doubt.” The woman held her knife toward [defender]. “This one looks the same sort!”

A man’s voice, low and gravelly, answered back. “Spy or not, we’ve got a troupe of orcs comin’ through tomorrow—one with a predilection for human meat, if ye catch my drift. Better to give ‘em a stranger than let the filthy beasts snack on one of our own.”

Fear unlike anything [defender] had known crawled into the pit of [pronoun3] stomach. Orcs, as everyone knew, preferred to eat their victims while still alive. “Please,” [pronoun1] yelled one last time. “You’ve misunderstood my intentions. I’m trying to help you!”

The goldfish paused. “Say, don’t you know someone—.” He swam a few laps, then continued. “An orc specialist, or the like?”

“That’s it!” [defender] replied in excitement. “Noah, you’re a genius! [contact] serves as a Minister on the Interrealm Orc Relations Committee. If we can get word to [contactPronoun2] in time, I’m sure [contactPronoun1]’ll save us.”

				<![CDATA[The man scratched his thinning hair as he looked back at the other townspeople. In one motion, they all raised from their seats.

[defender] tensed, unsure if [pronoun1] had been unwise in announcing [pronoun2]self. But before [pronoun1] could draw [pronoun3] [weapon], the townspeople began to clap. Soon they were pounding their tables, chanting “Defender, Defender, Defender,” over and over. 

“The Defender’s come ta save us from the light slayer,” a woman yelled over the applause. “A round of [beverage] on my tab.” 

“That’s right!” another woman yelled. “Down with the mad prince! Cheers ta the Defender! Cheers to the light’s return!”

[defender] raised [pronoun3] hands modestly. “Thank you,” [pronoun1] said. “The memory of your kind words will keep me company through the long night.”

The man in the apron slapped [pronoun2] on the back. “This’ll be one fer the stories,” he said. “Imagine a Defender stopping off at Famous Rey’s Bar & Grill. I’m Rey Peralta, owner and operator. I’ll be pleased ta offer anything ye like, free of charge.” He pulled a menu from his pocket and handed it to [pronoun2].

“A generous offer, Rey. One I gratefully accept,” [defender] said.

[defender] turned to [pronoun3] companion. “Well, [companionName], what shall it be?”]]>

				<![CDATA[“If you could add a few peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for me, that would be delightful,” [defender] added. “Thank you, kindly.”

“Straight away,” Rey said, and hurried off to the kitchen.

When [defender] sat down at one of the empty tables to wait, several of the townspeople joined [pronoun2]. 

“Where are ye headed?” one of the women asked.

“I am traveling to the Barrier Isles,” [defender] replied.

The townspeople gave a collective gasp. “Across tha Stormy Sea?” the woman pressed. “But what of the sea beasties?”

[defender] shrugged, trying to maintain an air of calm, but [pronoun3] heart quickened. In truth, [pronoun1] was terrified of the monsters that traveled the deep. “I travel with Captain Cleapeezious Sandowskly. I am told she has experience with these things.”

The townspeople nodded encouragingly. 

[companionName] interrupted before the conversation could continue. [companion2]
				
Rey returned at that moment with a burlap bag. He handed it to [defender] with a bow. “Defender, I hope this food helps ye through your journey. The people of this town will not survive much longer without your help.” He swept his hand toward the window. “We are dying. The farms. The crops. The villages of the continent. We won’t last through the winter.” 

[defender] rose from the table slowly, weighed down by the severity of [pronoun3] mission. “I shall do my best to serve the realm,” [pronoun1] said.  

Rey walked [pronoun2] to the door. “Thanks be to yer sacrifice,” he said. “And a word of advice, if I’m not overstepping?” 

“Yes?” [defender] asked.

“When ye reach The Cattery, it might be best to leave yer companion behind for a time. The felines have been known ta eat first and ask questions later, if ye know what I mean.” He nodded toward [companionName], lowering his voice. “The [companion] would make a right tasty snack.” 

“I will be sure to heed your words,” [defender] said as she shook Rey’s hand.

With that, [defender] stepped into the night, [pronoun3] companion at one side, supplies at the other. It was with equal parts excitement, dread, and sadness that [pronoun1] returned to the docks.]]>

The figure was too big to be the captain, but there was no one else in sight, so [pronoun1] and [companionName] walked toward the barrels. It was a man, [defender] realized as they approached. A large man, who stood as they drew near.

The man towered above [defender] and [companionName]. His height was amplified by his orange kilt and matching life vest. It strained across his broad chest. He took a moment to loosen one of its straps before giving [defender] a curt nod. “You must be the Defender, then. I’m the Cap’n’s first mate, Smeg.” He held out a second life vest.]]>

The first mate’s eyes widened. “Indeed,” he said, hastily plucking the sandwich from [defender]’s hand. He took an enormous bite. A look of contentment flooded his face.

“A fan of sandwiches?” [defender] asked, stifling a laugh.

“I’ve had nothing but sea biscuits for months,” Smeg replied between chews. “Any creature, man or beast, who spends too much time on the sea develops a fondness for land food.” He nodded happily. “This is a kindness I won’t soon forget.”

[defender] held the biscuit up for closer examination after almost losing a tooth. 

“I find they go down easier after a dunking,” Smeg suggested. “Mayhap in your [beverage]?”

“I see,” [defender] said. [Pronoun1] poured a bit of the liquid from [pronoun3] canteen over the biscuit, gingerly biting into it for a second time. It was edible, but only just. 

The first mate laughed at [defender]’s expression. “Tastes like dust, but the stuff lasts for months without spoiling—important on the sea. Just remember to add a splash of something before you eat it.”

			<weapon><![CDATA[[defender] skirted the slap of the squid’s giant tentacle. Before it could continue the attack, [pronoun1] screamed out one of the first spells [pronoun1]’d ever learned. “Bonkeratti Shrinkeroo!” For a terrifying moment, [defender] thought [pronoun1] was done for. The sea creature had climbed aboard the ship, its putrid body oozing toward [pronoun2]. But then, suddenly, the squid quivered and disappeared. [Pronoun1] looked down to see a tinier version squirming at [pronoun3] feet.

The crew gave a mighty cry of victory as they surrounded [pronoun2], pounding [pronoun3] back and raising [pronoun2] into the air. [Pronoun1] was pleased to hear the captain yell, “Respect to the Defender!” Boisterous cheers followed this declaration as [defender] thanked the crew modestly.

“Just doing my job,” [pronoun1] said. [Pronoun1] plucked the still squirming squid from the deck and took it to the side of the ship.

“Let’s cook it for dinner,” Smeg suggested. “I have a great calamari recipe.”

“Squish it til it’s dead!” another crewmate called.

But [defender] shook [pronoun3] head. “All creatures should be given a second chance,” [pronoun1] said. “I believe this one has learned its lesson.” [Pronoun1] tossed the squid over the side of the boat while the crew nodded at [pronoun3] obvious wisdom.

“And now,” [pronoun1] continued, “I shall retire to my hammock. Please wake me when we reach [island1].”

This time, when [defender] closed [pronoun3] eyes, it was to the sound of applause.]]></weapon>

But before [pronoun1] could celebrate [pronoun3] initial victory, the squid redoubled its efforts. Another giant tentacle slapped down next to [pronoun2].</TEXTFORMAT>

It was then that Smeg’s words came back to [pronoun2]. Perhaps [pronoun1] was going about this the wrong way. No doubt this creature wanted a snack, but it didn’t have to be the crew. [Pronoun1] held a peanut butter and jelly sandwich overhead as an enticement. 

“Hey up there,” [pronoun1] shouted. The squid turned its sharp teeth in [pronoun3] direction and paused, eyeing the sandwich. [defender] held [pronoun3] breath as [pronoun1] flung the sandwich into the giant mouth. After the squid gulped the sandwich down, its mouth somehow rearranged itself into a broad smile. 

<TEXTFORMAT LEFTMARGIN='250'>“Delicious,” the squid proclaimed. “Whatever do you call it?” 

“A peanut butter and jelly sandwich,” [defender] replied.

The squid smacked its lips contentedly. “I’ve been meaning to take more culinary risks,” it replied. “This is just the kind of land cuisine I’d been interested in sampling.”</TEXTFORMAT>

“Glad to be of service,” [defender] replied. “Now perhaps you could direct us to [island1]? We have a rather important quest to complete, so must be on our way.”

The squid nodded. “Of course,” it said. “But first, could you spare another sandwich?”

“By all means,” [defender] said, tossing another sandwich up to the squid.

It gulped it down before flashing another sharp-toothed smile at the crew. “You’ll find the [island1] that way,” it said as it slid back into the sea. One tentacle remained above water, pointing in the direction of the island.

The crew gaped at [defender] in astonishment, but [pronoun1] just shrugged. “It’s like I always say,” [pronoun1] explained.	






The captain gave a woop of victory as the crew surrounded [pronoun2], pounding [pronoun3] back and raising [pronoun2] into the air. From below [pronoun1] heard Smeg yell, “Respect to the Defender!” Boisterous cheers filled the air.

“Just doing my job,” [defender] said when the crew lowered [pronoun2] back down to the deck. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I believe I shall retire to my hammock. Please wake me when we reach [island1].”

It was then that something occurred to [pronoun2]. Perhaps [pronoun1] was going about this in the wrong way. After all, they were trespassing in the squid’s territory. Perhaps a melody would sooth its anger. 

“Hey up there,” [pronoun1] shouted. 

The squid turned its beady eyes in [pronoun3] direction, eyeing the [instrument] [pronoun1] held aloft for inspection.
















[defender] [instrument1] [Pronoun1] played a lugubrious ballad of remorse and sorrow, so tragic that even [pronoun1] began to tear up. When the song was finished, [pronoun1] paused to blow [pronoun3] nose. 

A sense of peace descended over the sea creature. It nodded its giant head and unwrapped its tentacles, slithering away from the ship to disappear beneath the waves. [defender] waited, [pronoun3] fingers crossed for luck. 

The wait was short lived, for a moment later one giant tentacle darted across the deck, directly toward [pronoun2]. But [pronoun1] stood fast, refusing on principle to show the fear that knotted [pronoun3] stomach. [Pronoun3] courage was rewarded as the tentacle unfurled itself to reveal a chest. When it dropped the chest at [defender]’s side, it burst open, scattering gold coins in all direction. “Lovely tune,” the squid said, popping its head up from the waves. It gave a gracious nod before sliding back down into the water.

The crew gaped at [defender] in astonishment, but [pronoun1] just shrugged. “Music is the interrealm language of peace.” [Pronoun1] gestured toward the chest. “Do feel free to help yourself to the treasure.”

The captain gave a woop of victory as the crew surrounded [defender], pounding [pronoun3] back and raising [pronoun2] into the air. From below [pronoun1] heard Smeg yell, “Long live the Defender!” Boisterous cheers filled the air.

The cat’s eyes slit into two narrow strips. “I see,” she replied. “Follow me.”

They walked through the shipyard toward a large, white building. A sign next to it read, “Welcome to The Cattery” on a placard. The Persian led the way through a revolving glass door, careful not to catch her voluminous tail. 

Once they were inside, the Persian gave [defender] a sharp glance. “Do you have anything to declare?”

“Why look who the cat dragged in,” the tabby said, chuckling at his joke. 

The Persian flicked her tail as her wide ears pressed back against her head.

“Oh, Olivia,” the tabby said to the Persian. “It was a joke.”

“Whatever you say, boss,” Olivia said, as she sauntered out of the room, slamming the door behind her.

The tabby shrugged his shoulders. “Persians. So temperamental. Comes from all of that fur no doubt.” His eyes swept over [defender]’s [wardrobeShort], pausing on [pronoun3] [instrument][companionComing1]. “You must be the latest Defender,” the tabby said. “You are no doubt here to see the Grand Vizier on the realm’s business. I’m Bruno Shulz, Director of Catling Affairs, keeper of the Vizier’s social calendar.”

[defender] was impressed. “Nice to meet you, Bruno. It is a pleasure to make the acquaintance of such a well-informed individual.” [companionComing2]

The tabby nodded politely as he opened a thick book on his desk to flip through several pages. “The vizier holds a weekly ball at his palace. You may attend tonight if you’d like to speak with him publicly. I could also squeeze you in earlier for a private audience over his lunch hour. Which do you prefer?”

He extended a paw to [defender] to shake [pronoun3] hand. [companionComing2]

“Come along,” Olivia demanded. “I haven’t all day.”

After a quick jaunt down a road surrounded by a clawed wooden fence, they reached an ornate building. The reek of wet cat made [defender] wrinkle [pronoun3] nose.

The Persian pointed a paw toward the front door. “Ask for Monsieur Bleujeanna when you get inside and let him know to prepare you for the ball. I’ll be by to pick you up in a few hours. Happy grooming.”

[defender][companionComing3] walked into the Groomery, stopping off at the front desk. 

A lanky Siamese sat behind the counter. “Welcome to Monsieur Bleujeanna’s,” she said. 

“I’m here to see Bleujeanna,” [defender] replied. “In preparation for the Vizier’s ball.”

The Siamese put down the file she’d been sharpening her claws with to press a button. A door swung open behind her desk. “You’ll find him down the hallway, fourth door on the left.”

[companionComing4]

As [defender] walked down the hallway, [pronoun1] passed several closed doors. A cacophony of sounds came from behind them: yowls, purrs, the hum of what [defender] assumed were electric hair trimmers, running water, even some hisses. But when [pronoun1] reached the third door, [pronoun1] stopped. Monsieur Bleujeanna would be waiting for [pronoun2] at the next door, but from behind this one [pronoun1] heard what sounded like crying. What if someone had been hurt? [defender] had sworn an oath to protect the realm. Whatever lay beyond this door was, after all, a part of the realm too. Still, just because someone was crying didn’t mean they needed or wanted [pronoun3] help. The last thing [defender] wanted to do was pry.]]></item>

[defender] did [pronoun3] best to tolerate the barrage of attention as the hours passed. A wreath of flowers was placed over [pronoun3] hair.

Next to the trees a large section of the lawn was roped off with a sign that read “No Trespassing”.]]>

The cat sighed. “The entire island is overwrought with a mouse problem.

The vizier has been beside himself.” The chauffer opened the door to the limo, extending a paw to assist Olivia as she stepped out. “Speaking of which,” she said. “The vizier is expecting you.

As [pronoun1] took another step, [pronoun1] felt an odd shortness of breath. The next step had [pronoun2] panting, causing [pronoun3] to drop down to [pronoun3] knees. Something was wrong with [pronoun3] lungs. [Pronoun1] looked back toward Olivia who watched through slitted eyes.]]>

[defender] tried to answer, but [pronoun1] couldn’t speak. [Pronoun3] last thought as [pronoun1] tipped over into the toxic grass was of the Realm.

The vizier nipped [defender]’s arm. “The realm can wait,” Alphonse announced. “We’ve already had appetizers. And I grow hungry. 








[defender] stepped back in horror. The cats had formed a circle around [pronoun2]; [pronoun1] took another step back. There had to be a way out of this situation. Two possibilities popped into [pronoun3] mind. She remembered the captain’s advice. ‘If all else fails, give them a scratch behind the ears,’ Cleapeezious had suggested. In addition, an idea had just occurred to [pronoun3] of how to end the island’s mouse infestation problem once and for all. [defender] always did think better under pressure.]]></false>

Jets of water streamed in a high arc over the structure, shimmering in the twilight. [defender] smiled, delighted to realize the [companion] was so well appreciated here on the Cattery Island.

Inside the mansion, a ball was underway. The fading light streamed in through the windows on each side of the ballroom. Dozens of well-clad cats waltzed in the center of the room. One of them—the Director of Catling Affairs, Bruno Schulz—waved as [defender] walked in. Beyond the dance floor rose a tall dais. A gray cat with a large belly lounged atop it. He wore a silk tuxedo and watched the dancers through a golden monocle.

“It cannot last,” [defender] replied. “The continent is devoid of light. Soon Prince Nero’s hunger will spread to the Barrier Isles as well. Then what will you do?”

The vizier cocked his gray head in thought.

The cats gave a collective hiss. “What of it?” the vizier asked suspiciously.

“It is a well known fact,” [defender] continued, “that mice are drawn to music. I shall simply play my [instrument] to lure them onto the front lawn.”

“An interesting idea,” the vizier admitted. 

“In exchange for my services,” [defender] continued, doing [pronoun3] best to sound confident, “I’ll require your cat’s eye stone.”

“I agree to the terms,” the vizier said, “on one condition. You must also remove the rodents from the island. I’ve had quite enough of their taunting.”]]>

“It’s simple logic,” [defender] assured him, pulling out [pronoun3] [instrument]. “Bop enough mice on the head and they’ll find somewhere else to go. Follow me and I’ll show you.”

The vizier nipped [defender]’s arm. “The realm can wait,” Alphonse announced. “I grow hungry. After I snack on the [companion], I believe you’ll make the perfect main course.”

[defender] eyed the cat in horror, thinking back on the events that had brought [pronoun2] to this moment. [Pronoun1] should never have agreed to trade [pronoun3] companion. Knowing what [pronoun1] did about cats, [pronoun1] should have left [companionName] behind, so the felines wouldn’t have been distracted. If only [pronoun1] could try again…

“[companionName] is not mine to trade,” [defender] replied. “Anything else we may discuss, but this is not an arrangement I am at liberty to make.” 

Vizier Alphonse swished his tail in disappointment. “Very well, then there shall be no trade.”

“But sir,” [defender] began. 

“Dismissed,” the vizier said, clapping his paws together decisively. “Resume the dance.”

[defender] and [companionName] were escorted back to the Stormin’ Norman, but without the cat’s eye, there was no hope of saving the realm. As [defender] considered [pronoun3] failed trip to the Cattery, [pronoun1] realized that if [pronoun1] had left [pronoun3] companion behind on the Stormin’ Norman, [pronoun3] trip might have ended quite differently.

Instead [defender] would now be forced to watch helplessly as the realm descended into eternal darkness, knowing [pronoun1] had only [pronoun2]self to blame.

“Please,” he said, grumpily.
 
The Persian smiled. “Whatever you want, boss.” She looked at his cigar, crinkling her nose. “Just as soon as you get rid of that offensive thing.”

She stood there until Bruno sighed, then tapped the cigar out in an ashtray. “That will be all, Olivia,” the tabby said.

The Persian turned to [defender][companionComing2] “Follow me,” she said.

Olivia led the way to a limo waiting outside, and soon they were hurtling across the countryside. [defender] admired the leafy countryside as they traveled, though as [pronoun1] inspected the land [pronoun1] realized that many of the leaves and grass looked as if they had been nibbled. [Pronoun1] was about to ask Olivia about the strange vegetation when they pulled up outside of a beautiful, marble mansion. The chauffeur opened the limo door and the Persian stepped out daintily. “Follow me,” she said. 

A pathway made from braided twine lead around the mansion, to a doorway concealed by greenery. They entered, walking down the hallway into a formal dining room. 

Olivia pointed a paw toward a plump, gray cat lounging on a red cushion at the head of the table. “The vizier,” she announced.]]>

The vizier simply stared as [defender] rushed on.

“I stand before you today on a mission from the realm. Soon Prince Nero will control the skies, and we will all be beholden to his whims. I know you don’t want this.”

“I have no quarrel with the prince,” the vizier replied. “Our sunlight remains. He will not dare to trespass on our land.” 

“It cannot last,” [defender] replied. “The light has been eaten from the continent. We must work to overpower him before he turns his hunger to the islands as well.”

The vizier smiled, revealing a row of sharp, white teeth. “Speaking of hunger, it is lunch time.” He picked up a silver bell sitting next to him and rang it. Two shorthaired cats in chef hats padded into the room. 

“You rang, vizier,” the larger said.

[companionComing3]

Before [defender] could react, [pronoun3] hands had been pinned behind [pronoun3] back and [pronoun3] [weapon] plucked from [pronoun3] [wardrobeShort]. “This is outrageous!” [defender] shouted. “Release me! I’m the Defender of the Realm!”

The vizier rang his tinkling bell again. “Soon you’ll be my lunch.” He swept a dismissive paw in the air as the cats pulled [defender][companionComing2] away, toward the kitchen, and toward…

[companion1]

“Next time I vow to take you with me,” [defender] promised. “But this island was no place for a/an [companion].” [Pronoun1] held up the cat’s eye as [companionName] gasped. “The important thing is that I have the stone, is it not?”

[companion2]

“Well done,” the captain agreed. “Now that you have the cat’s eye, you’ll be granted cat’s vision and be able to spot Nero’s floating island in the darkness. [pearlObtained]

Cleapeezious paused to scrub a hand through her white hair. “Frankly, I thought we’d lift anchor without you.” The captain grinned at [defender]’s frown. “I’m pleased to be wrong.” 

The crew gathered around as they spoke, shouting out their agreement.

“Way to go, Defender,” Smeg called.

“I knew you could do it,” another crewmember yelled.

“Let’s celebrate,” another voice hollered.

[defender] gave a small bow, letting their words and enthusiasm wash over [pronoun2]. Perhaps a small celebration was in order. After all, [pronoun1] now possessed the cat’s eye. [stones1]

The captain arched her eyebrows into twin peaks. “What will it be, Defender? Will we linger through the night or cast off now?”]]>

Vizier Alphonse, accompanied by dozens of drooling cats, had surrounded them. 

“Ahem,” he said, examining an extended claw. “I’ve spoken to Prince Nero. We’ve renegotiated our arrangement and he’s been very generous. On one condition, naturally. I’m going to need the cat’s eye back.”

“Never,” [defender] spat.]]>

“Cat’s honor,” the vizier purred, holding up one paw.

[defender] pulled the cat’s eye from [pronoun3] [weapon] and handed it to Alphonse. 

The vizier pocketed the stone with an apologetic smile. “Cat’s have no honor,” he said, turning to the surrounding cats. “Execute them. But save the Defender for last.”]]>

“Of course,” Oonie replied. “I’m a bird, am I not?”

[defender] and [companionName] looked out across the sea to find a craggy mountain jutting up from the waves. 

“The Joyless Mountains,” [companionName] announced.

“It’s very,” [defender] paused, trying to find the word. [Pronoun1] finally settled on, “very high.” [Pronoun1] hadn’t realized just how tall the mountain would be. Still, there was no point in dwelling on heights. “One way or another, we will get to the top and find the ancient serpent, Snowmonch,” [defender] said.

[companionName] nodded in agreement. 

“First things first, let’s find the captain to see about transport to the island,” [defender] continued. 

[defender] and [companionName] struck out together, finding Cleapeezious at the helm of the ship. The captain’s right eye was pressed against her eyeglass, inspecting the mountain. “Have a look,” she said, handing [defender] the glass. “Tide is out and the island is surrounded by underwater reefs. Either way I won’t be able to get us any closer. But a smaller craft could make it through. You can take the dingy if you’re ready now.”

“No time like the present,” [defender] replied.

“Very well,” the captain said. “Just make sure to leave plenty of slack on the line when you tie it up. The water in this region can rise unexpectedly high.”

“Thank you,” [defender] said. [Pronoun1] felt a knot forming in [pronoun3] stomach. Of all of the isles, this was the one [pronoun1] knew the least about. “Any last advice before we cast off?” [pronoun1] asked the captain.

Cleapeezious scratched her head. “No one’s ever come back from the Joyless Mountains, so I couldn’t rightly say.” Cleapeezious clapped [defender] on the back jovially.]]> 				</item>

			<![CDATA[Thirty minutes later, [defender] and [companionName] had rowed across the sea, careful to avoid the algae-covered rocks jutting up from the water. They landed on a narrow, rocky beach at the foot of the Joyless Mountain. An ascending escalator touched down to the beach not ten feet from where they stood. It wrapped up around the side of the mountain, out of sight.

[defender] eyed it suspiciously. “There’s something that just seems too easy about all of this, don’t you think?”

[companion1]

[defender] pondered their path. The escalator wrapped out of sight quickly. What would happen on the other side? [Pronoun1] looked up the wall of the mountain. It was smooth, with few handholds. It would be a challenging ascent. 

[Pronoun1] remembered the captain’s words as [pronoun1] made [pronoun3] decision. ‘No one’s ever come back from the Joyless Mountains,’ Cleapeezious had said. [defender] was going to be the first.]]>

			<![CDATA[Instead, [pronoun1] walked over the rocky wall of the mountain and looked up. It had few outcroppings of rocks to use as handholds, but at least [pronoun1] could see where [pronoun1] was going. The top of the mountain was visible, despite a few wisps of clouds that drifted by. 

“I think we should climb,” [pronoun1] announced.

“But you don’t have any climbing gear,” [companionName] replied.

“We’ll just have to be careful,” [defender] replied. 

[companion1]

[defender] cupped [pronoun3] hand over an outcropping of rocks overhead. [Pronoun1] hoisted [pronoun2]self up, pausing to look for [pronoun3] next handhold. [Pronoun1] reached to the left where a bit of rock jutted out so [pronoun1] could pull [pronoun2]self up. [Pronoun1] went on like this for a time, scaling the side of the mountain bit by bit. 

[companion2]

[defender] climbed and climbed until finally, [pronoun1] reached an impasse. A huge section of the mountain extruded out above [pronoun3] head, creating a sloping ceiling. It would be impossible to go any further because [pronoun3] arms had begun to ache with the effort of climbing. [Pronoun1] carefully backtracked, climbing down just far enough to find an alternate route.

“Now what?” [companionName] asked.

“If you insist,” [companionName] replied doubtfully. 

[defender] ignored [pronoun3] companion’s tone. [Pronoun1] also ignored the tremble in [pronoun3] exhausted arms as [pronoun1] climbed this new path. As [pronoun1] ascended the mountain, [pronoun1] noticed that the footholds and handholds seemed to be shrinking. Most were no bigger than [pronoun3] fist. But [pronoun1] had no choice.

Perhaps the cave would offer an alternate path up the mountain. At the very least it would be a place to rest. [Pronoun1] looked at the opening suspiciously. Then again, perhaps it was the home of a wild, carnivorous creature.

As [pronoun1] tumbled down through the air, [pronoun1] had a sudden clarity of thought. Oonie was right. [Pronoun1] should have recognized [pronoun3] limitations.

[defender] looked at [pronoun3] companion in surprise. “But,” [pronoun1] faltered. “It’s a pile of treasure. And it’s so… shiny. I mean, who—outside of fairytales, anyway—just runs smack into a pile of treasure?” 

[companionName] gave [pronoun2] a disappointed look.

“Maybe just a quick look?” [defender] proposed.]]>

Large piles of the stuff were usually placed in a hero’s path as a form of entrapment. And so, with great sorrow, [pronoun1] walked around the treasure to the elevator. Once inside, [pronoun1] realized there were only two buttons.

One One read “Penthouse”. The 
other read, “Lobby”.]]>

Far out in the waves [pronoun1] could make out the Stormin’ Norman, bobbing like a toy boat. In the other direction loomed a forest of gnarled trees. A path led under the canopy of branches. It was coated in an oily, black residue, with smoke drifting up from its surface. The higher branches of the trees were coated in ice, but those closest to the path had melted. Their drips rained down, splashing the path with a hiss. A discarded shield lay beside the path, half buried in the ground. A hole was burned into its center. 

[defender]’s heart thudded against [pronoun3] chest. “This must be the way to Snowmonch,” [pronoun1] announced, trying to sound confident despite [pronoun3] growing alarm.

[companion2]

[defender] unscrewed the lid to [pronoun3] [beverage] and took a long drink. [Pronoun1] then did a series of breathing exercises. After that, [pronoun1] jumped around to loosen up. And after that, when there was nothing else [pronoun1] could possibly think of to stall [pronoun3] visit, [pronoun1] and [companionName] set off down the path to find Snowmonch.]]>

“I’m sorry,” [pronoun1] said. “I was distracted.” [Pronoun1] hung [pronoun3] head. “And I was greedy. I should have known better.”

[defender] and [companionName] settled into the air pocket for the night. [defender] slept fitfully, awakened by dreams of the realm’s collapse.

[Pronoun1] would have to remain true to [pronoun3] mission in the days ahead, or the realm wouldn’t stand a chance against Nero.

In the morning, when the tide receded, [pronoun1] summoned the elevator. Once inside, [pronoun1] noticed a sign that read: “Closed for Maintenance.” [defender] sighed as [pronoun1] and [companionName] backtracked through the tunnel toward the cave opening. [defender] rubbed [pronoun3] arms, wincing as [pronoun1] did so. [Pronoun1] was definitely feeling the effects of the previous day’s climb, and a sleepless night certainly didn’t help anything.

Below [pronoun2], the sea unfurled itself in shimmering aquamarine folds. White tufts of clouds drifted overhead and [pronoun1] spotted one that looked like [companionName]. [defender] turned to point the cloud out to [pronoun3] companion, but stopped when [pronoun1] saw the look of tranquility that had settled over the [companion].

[companion1]

The two rode in silence until all too soon, the escalator came to a stop. A sign hung overhead. It read: Resting Platform. [defender] stepped onto the platform to see the view.

This part of the mountain was covered in leafy trees, with a dirt path leading away from the platform into the woods. Ten paces in front of [pronoun2], another escalator resumed its uphill path around the mountain.]]>

As [defender] scrambled to [pronoun3] feet, [pronoun1] noticed something else was amiss as well. The ground was covered in dirt, not grass. [Pronoun1] attempted to steady [pronoun2]self on the tree trunk. It felt like petrified rock as [pronoun1] reached for it.

[defender] reached into [pronoun3] pocket and pulled out [pronoun3] flashlight. [Pronoun1] ran the dim beam over what had been the clearing. Everything had turned to dust. “What happened?” [pronoun1] asked, trying [pronoun3] best to remain calm. [Pronoun1] pointed the light toward [companionName] and sucked in [pronoun3] breath. [Pronoun3] companion looked even more terrified than [pronoun1] felt.

[companion3]

“What do you mean?” [defender] asked, keeping the flashlight trained on [pronoun3] companion. “What is a Scobell tree?”

[companion4]

It took a moment for the truth to sink in. [defender] looked around the clearing. The tree was gnarled. The grass was dirt. There wasn’t a living thing for miles. 

And then the truth sunk in further. 

There wasn’t a living thing… anywhere. Nero had completed his evil mission. The realm’s sunlight was gone. Everyone [pronoun1] had known was also gone. And soon, without sunlight, and trapped on an island, [defender] and [companionName] would be gone too. Had [pronoun1] only stayed true to [pronoun3] mission, none of this would ever have happened.]]>

This time the escalator wrapped around to the opposite side of the mountain, which was entirely different looking. For one thing, the face of the mountain was dirt and rock, without any green at all. For another, several signs were posted along the way. They read things like “Private Property”, “Keep Out”, and “No Menus”.

“Not a very friendly welcoming,” [defender] commented as they passed the largest sign yet. It read: “My Kid is an Honor Student at Serpentine Academy.”

“Ignore the signs,” a high-pitched voice suggested from behind. “They’re just there to keep out the riffraff.”

[defender] whirled around to find a winged monkey flying next to [pronoun3] head. The monkey wore a tiny gray suit draped with a red sash. The sash was covered with buttons and tiny flag pins.]]>

			<![CDATA[“Hello there,” [defender] greeted the newcomer politely, for you never knew who you might be addressing. 

“Hello,” the monkey replied. He flew down to perch on a step in front of them. “Are you registered voters?” he inquired.  

[defender] and [companionName] exchanged a look. “I’m actually not from around here,” [defender] hedged. “Just visiting.”

The monkey’s face lit up. “A visitor!” he exclaimed. “Why we at the METS just love visitors!” He dug around in his pockets and pulled out a pamphlet and thrust it toward [defender]. “My name is Pappathon, and I’m a representative for the METS.” He looked at them expectantly. 

“The METS?” [defender] inquired.

Pappathon nodded in excitement. “I’m sure you’ve heard of us,” he continued. He unbuttoned a pin from his sash and handed it to [defender], tapping on the word METS printed over the center. “We’re the Monkeys for the Ethical Treatment of Sunlight! And me oh my, what an exciting time for you to arrive! Why, we’re having a rally today, and we’d love for you to come and hear our speakers. We’ve got a foolproof ten-step plan to bring the sunlight back to the realm.” He thrust a small fist into the air. “Down with Nero!” he yelled.

[companion1]

“Say,” Pappathon continued, his eyes ping ponging between [defender] and [companionName]. “You’re not—” he paused excitedly. “But you ARE! You’re wearing the [wardrobeShort] and you’re with the [companion]. Why, you’re the Defender of the Realm!”

“Well, yes,” [defender] replied, suddenly uncomfortable with the monkey’s enthusiasm. “I am.” 

“What an honor!” Pappathon exclaimed. “What a privilege!” he continued, his voice growing louder until he was shouting.]]>

[defender] and [companionName] exchanged another look. 

“Ten minutes is all I’m asking,” Pappathon begged. 

“We’re on a tight schedule,” [defender] said.

“But there’s snacks,” the monkey added helpfully.]]>

“Oh yes,” Pappathan said. “All kinds of snacks. We have a nice selection of cheeses, sandwiches with the crusts cut off, even salads if you’re looking for something on the lighter side. And cookies too,” he added hastily.

That did it. “I suppose we could delay for ten minutes,” [defender] said.

“I don’t know,” [companionName] began.

			<![CDATA[And so [defender] and [companionName] followed Pappathon down a forest path lined by tall, leafy trees that lead into a clearing. A group of at least 100 monkeys, all wearing matching red sashes, were riveted by a speaker who perched atop a podium. She was smaller than the rest, and her wings were folded tidily across the back of her suit jacket. A banner hung next to her that read Stay Strong with the METS. She appeared to be mid speech.

The speaker raised a microphone to her lips right as Pappathan guided [defender] and [companionName] toward the snack table.

“I want to leave you all with three important words to think about,” she shouted into the microphone. “Duty. Courage. Strength. Let those three small words serve as your rallying cry in the days to come. We must recall our duty to this realm and all of its denizens. We must have courage to look into the darkness, knowing it cannot last. And we must remember that together we are stronger than alone. Together, we have the strength to overpower Nero. Together, we can create a better, lighter realm, for all.” 

The speaker bowed her head and a thunder of applause drowned out her thanks. She flew down from the podium and shook hands with the different audience members, eventually flying over to the snack table, where [defender] was polishing off a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with the crust cut off.]]>

			<![CDATA[[defender] knew better than to speak with [pronoun3] mouth full, and so finished chewing [pronoun3] sandwich while trying to smile at the same time. It was harder than [pronoun1] had expected. “I’m [defender],” [pronoun1] finally said after swallowing. “And this is [companionName]. We’re very pleased to meet you.”

Barbie gasped. “The Defender! And [pronoun3] companion!” She took [defender]’s hand yet again and pumped it up and down in excitement. “What an honor!” She turned to [companionName] and continued to gush. “Why you are an absolute inspiration to METS everywhere.” Barbie turned around to the other members at the rally. “Listen everyone. The Defender and [pronoun3] companion are here!”

Immediately a cheer rang out over the clearing. 

[defender] nodded slightly. “Thank you so much for the friendly greeting and hospitality,” [pronoun1] said. “But we really do need to get going. I have urgent business with Snowmonch.”

“Oh Snowmonch,” Barbie said scornfully. “That old serpent never leaves her cave, and when she does, she’s a terror. No one ever comes back from the top of the Joyless Mountains. I think she must eat them… forget Snowmonch.” Barbie’s eyes shone as she unfurled her wings, fluttering upward until she was eye level with [defender]. “Join us. With your involvement, others will join us. We’d be able to rally so many members to fight for the cause! Let me just walk you through some literature.”

[defender] and [companionName] spent the next hour listening to Barbie outline her strategy for defeating Nero. The monkey had a firm understanding of both military procedure and political campaigning. [defender] was surprised to find [pronoun2]self nodding [pronoun3] head in agreement with much of what Barbie had to say. By the end of the second hour, [defender] was finishing the monkey’s sentences.

“Well,” Barbie concluded, after sharing her ten-step plan for realm domination, “what do you think? Would you like to join us? You could help finalize the ten steps.]]>

			<![CDATA[[defender] considered the proposition carefully. On one hand, there was no reason [pronoun1] had to defeat Nero alone. On the other, [pronoun1] already had a perfectly good plan in place that [pronoun1] thought would work. [Pronoun1] glanced at [companionName], whose look of indecision matched [pronoun3] own.

			<![CDATA[[Pronoun1] and Barbie spent the next week revising the ten-step plan in detail, carefully identifying how the METS and their allies might overthrow Nero. They spent the following week with [companionName] editing the ten steps down to seven. The week after, they shared the plan with their constituents on the Board of METS, who had an additional two steps they wanted to add to the plan. Unfortunately, no one liked the idea of a nine-step plan as it seemed unbalanced. 

During the fourth week, they hired an outside advisor who specialized in drafting foolproof step-by-step plans. During the fifth week they shared the revisions with the Board of METS once again, and this time were given far fewer changes. When the sixth week arrived, Barbie took a much needed vacation and came back rested and ready to work through the seventh week. And they did just that, diligently. Right until the eighth week arrived, at which point Nero sucked the remaining sunlight from the realm. 

As eternal darkness descended over the land, and the METS continued to discuss the final draft of their now sixteen-point manifesto, [defender] realized that had [pronoun1] only stayed true to [pronoun3] original plan instead of getting distracted by someone else’s, [pronoun1] might have saved the realm.]]>

[Pronoun1] and [companionName] walked for a few minutes until they stood beneath a gigantic tree. It was cold this high up, and [pronoun1] shivered slightly. In one direction, [pronoun1] could see the ocean. Far out in the waves [pronoun1] could make out the Stormin’ Norman, bobbing like a toy boat. In the other direction loomed a forest of gnarled trees. A path led under the canopy of branches. It was coated in an oily, black residue, with smoke drifting up from its surface. The higher branches of the trees were coated in ice, but those closest to the path had melted. Their drips rained down, splashing the path with a hiss. A discarded shield lay beside the path, half buried in the ground. A hole was burned into its center. 

[defender]’s heart thudded against [pronoun3] chest. “This must be the way to Snowmonch,” [pronoun1] announced, trying to sound confident despite [pronoun3] growing alarm.

[companion1]

[defender] unscrewed the lid to [pronoun3] [beverage] and took a long drink. [Pronoun1] then did a series of breathing exercises. After that [pronoun1] jumped around to loosen up.

			<![CDATA[[defender] and [companionName] set out down the pathway. Despite the snow surrounding them, the pathway was sweltering. Steam rose up from its blacktop, [wardrobe1]

The two continued on their way quietly. Beads of sweat slipped down the back of [defender]’s neck. [companion1]

The sound of rumbling thunder could be heard from ahead. [defender] gritted [pronoun3] teeth, reminding [pronoun2]self that Snowmonch was just another creature—just like [pronoun2]. Even if the serpent had power over fire. And from the sounds of it, thunder too. 

Eventually the pathway opened up to a circular blacktop. A white serpent coiled in the center, snoring. Drool (poisonous, [defender] suspected) oozed through her fangs, hissing as it hit the ground beneath her massive body. Steam billowed from her mouth and nostrils and a tuft of red hair coiled out from under her tiny hat. But all of that was really irrelevant, because nestled in the palm of Snowmonch’s disproportionately small, claw-tipped paw, was the serpentine stone. It glinted in the sunlight, as if challenging [defender] to take it.

[defender] looked away from [pronoun3] companion, scuffing [pronoun3] foot against the black pathway in embarrassment. “Yes, I suppose you’re right,” [pronoun1] agreed. And yet, the serpentine stone twinkled brightly in invitation.]]>

Unfortunately for [defender], Snowmonch breathed fire when yawning. [defender]’s last thought before being consumed by flames was that [pronoun3] companion was right. Stealing was dishonorable, no matter how tired a person was, or who a person was stealing from.]]>

Instead, [pronoun1] cleared [pronoun3] throat, and called out in a friendly tone. “Pardon me, Snowmonch. I’m terribly sorry to disturb your rest, but do you have a few moments to discuss the state of the realm?”]]>

			<![CDATA[The serpent’s long tail unfurled across the blacktop. She stretched her mouth into a mighty yawn, spilling flames out from around her fangs. [defender] took a few steps back in concern. After another stretch that sent ripples through Snowmonch’s long body, the serpent rolled over and opened her orange eyes. Individual fires burned from within each of her pupils. 

[defender] took a step forward, and bowed deeply at the waist. “My name is [defender], and this,” [pronoun1] said, with a sweep of [pronoun3] hand, “is [companionName]. We offer you greetings.” [defender] paused, trying to think of anything else polite that [pronoun1] could add. An honest compliment was usually considered appropriate when dealing with serpents. “What an extraordinary hat.” [defender] winced, hoping [pronoun1] didn’t get eaten.

Snowmonch continued to stare at them. Steam billowed from her mouth, and [defender] did [pronoun3] best to ignore the waves of heat. When the serpent finally spoke, it wasn’t “beware” or “turn back while you still can” or anything else particularly menacing. Instead, words tumbled out almost faster than [defender] could follow.

“Ohmygosh!” the serpent said in a high-pitched squeal. “My name is Snowmonch and I’m pleased as punch that you like my hat, because I love [wardrobe1] It’s simply impossible to find anything becoming in extra extra extra extra extra extra large. ]]>

			<![CDATA[Before [defender] could formulate an answer the serpent rushed on. 

“I’m delighted to have visitors stop by. I get so lonely up here all alone. No one ever drops by and when they do they’re always running at me with swords or conjuring these terrible spells and it’s just rude.” Snowmonch sniffed. “I don’t know where people are learning their manners these days.” 

The serpent flipped her massive tail through the air. [defender] noticed the end looked very much like a giant butcher knife. [Pronoun1] jumped to one side to avoid being hit. “Well, I’ve always thought…” [defender] began, but the serpent continued on, unfazed.

“Oh you both must stay for dinner. I’m making my Meatless Meatloaf Surprise. I’ll give you a hint on the ingredients. I use a can of Rotell tomatoes and a dash of Tabasco sauce for an extra kick. Sounds yummy, right?” The serpent didn’t pause for an answer. “Afterward, we could play some word games. I just love word games, don’t you? Such a thinking person’s game.”  Snowmonch curled her tail over a nearby tree branch and pressed it down. A cover over the blacktop slid to one side revealing an immense circular slide. “It’s right this way.” Snowmonch looked at them hopefully.
  
[defender] was taken aback. Snowmonch wasn’t at all what [pronoun1] had imagined. But that didn’t mean [pronoun1] wanted to follow the serpent into her lair. What if it was a trick? Perhaps it would be best to ask for the serpentine stone out here, where [pronoun1] and [companionName] had a chance of retreat. Still, serpents were notoriously emotional, and the last thing [pronoun1] wanted to do was offend this one.]]>

Unfortunately, time is of the essence. Although you have not yet experienced Prince Nero’s light thievery, the rest of the realm now waits in darkness. It has come down to me—” 

[companionName] cleared [companionPronoun3] throat pointedly.

“And my companion, [companionName], to collect the four stones we need to defeat Nero and return the light to the realm.”

Snowmonch’s bottom lip trembled. “You mean…” she began, her words tremulous, “that you don’t want to come in for dinner?”

Before [defender] could plead [pronoun3] case further, the serpent began to cry. Inconsolable, acidic tears rained down upon the blacktop. [defender] did [pronoun3] best to dodge them, but unfortunately, a drop the size of a watermelon splat right into [pronoun3] chest. [Pronoun3] last thought was one of regret for being impatient with the serpent, who obviously just wanted to be friends. A moment later [pronoun1] was vaporized.]]>

The serpent seemed nice, if a little lonely. [defender] certainly understood what it was like to be lonely. Which is why [pronoun1] finally said, “We’d be delighted to join you for dinner.” 

Snowmonch’s eyes burned brightly, and she smiled a sharp, toothy grin. “Company!’ she squealed. “Oh you won’t regret it. This recipe has been handed down for generations.” Snowmonch slithered toward the opening in the blacktop surface and squeezed her way onto the slide. “Follow me!” she called as she slipped down into the darkness. 

“I guess we’d better follow,” [defender] said.

[companion1]


They went over to the pit, sat down at the top of the winding slide, and shoved off. Moments later [defender] and [companionName] were zipping down through the darkness, looping their way through the belly of the mountain. They passed a glowing sign as they descended.]]>

			<![CDATA[A moment later the slide ended and [defender] exited with grace befitting a Defender. [Pronoun1] patted off [pronoun3] [wardrobeShort] as [pronoun1] looked around.

Snowmonch’s cave had been furnished with an eclectic mix of mid-century modern furniture, intricately designed rugs, and a collection of copper pots hanging beside an open fire ventilated by an overhead pipe. Jazz music tinkled from a victrola in the corner. On the wall beside it hung a line of oil paintings featuring stately looking serpents. All of them wore tiny hats. 

“Sit, sit,” Snowmonch said, motioning them toward a dining table in the center of the room. Tapered candles burned in the center of the table, and a crystal chandelier hung from above. 

The serpent bustled around the cave, opening cupboards and bringing plates and silverware to the table. She then stabbed her tail right into the center of the fire, skewering something that looked like a charred log. She dropped it into the center of the table. “The Meatless Meatloaf Surprise,” she said, looking pleased with herself, “is served.”

[defender] looked at the blackened mound skeptically. It smelled of burnt rubber, but [pronoun1] seated [pronoun2]self across from the serpent all the same.

When she had gotten herself under control, she continued. “It could be an apple, but not an orange; the grass, but not the dirt, though,” she amended, “either one could be green. And it could assuredly be a pretty little rattlesnake egg. Oh I do love a rattlesnake egg, don’t you?”

[defender] was unsure of how to answer this question, and wisely kept [pronoun3] mouth shut.

“Now it’s your turn,” Snowmonch said.” “Tell me what it could be, and what it couldn’t, and the stone is yours.”

[defender] smiled at Snowmonch. “I’d be delighted to return when I have defeated Nero.”

The serpent sighed, but extended her claw nevertheless, opening it to reveal the serpentine stone. “Here you are then. Not only will the stone grant you the power of fire, but you’ll also be able to melt anything that stands in your way,” Snowmonch instructed. “Now get out there and show that prince who’s boss!”]]>

The crew greeted them with a cheer.

“Well done,” Captain Cleapeezious shouted over the applause. “We didn’t expect to see you back so soon. Or at all, really.”

[defender] just shook [pronoun3] head. [Pronoun1]’d never doubted [pronoun3] quest for a moment, for [pronoun1] represented the realm, and the realm could not fail. [Pronoun1] held up the serpentine stone with a flourish before placing it in [pronoun3] [weapon]. “We have what we came for!

The crew cheered even louder.

			<intro id="cattery"><![CDATA[There could be no rest until all of the stones were collected, so it was with a heavy heart that [defender] thanked the crew for their offer of a celebration, and instead selected the next island. Despite some good-natured rumbling, the crew raised anchor and set sail toward Shipwreck Cove. Exhausted after [pronoun3] time with the cats, [defender] promptly fell into a deep sleep. 

The first mate’s shadow fell over [defender] and this, rather than the sunlight, was finally what woke [pronoun2]. 

“We’ve arrived,” Smeg announced. A frown crossed his face as he looked out at the waves. “And if I know the captain, she’ll take us no closer. They don’t call this Shipwreck Cove for naught.”
]]></intro> 
			<intro id="joyless"><![CDATA[As the captain set sail for Shipwreck Cove, [defender] and [companion] regaled the crew with the details of their trip with Snowmonch. ”She’s really a very nice serpent,” [defender] concluded [pronoun3] story. “Just misunderstood, like a lot of people.” 

[Pronoun3] audience was quietly thoughtful as [defender] and [companionName] stood. “Smeg,” [pronoun1] called. “Will you wake us when we reach the cove?”

“Sure thing,” the first mate replied. 

Smeg woke [defender] up the next morning with a shake. “We’ve arrived,” he announced. A frown crossed his face as he looked out at the waves. “And if I know the captain, she’ll take us no closer. They don’t call this Shipwreck Cove for naught.”]]></intro> 
		<intro><![CDATA[Soon [defender] would collect all of the enchanted stones. When that occurred it would be time to face Nero and accomplish what [pronoun1] had come to the realm to do. But for now, [pronoun3] eyelids hung low… [pronoun1] seemed to be weighed down with weariness. [Pronoun1] and [companionName] found their hammocks, knowing they would be awakened when they reached the Shipwreck Cove. 

The first mate’s shadow fell over [defender] and this, rather than the sunlight, was finally what woke [pronoun2]. 

“We’ve arrived,” Smeg announced. A frown crossed his face as he looked out at the waves. “And if I know the captain, she’ll take us no closer. They don’t call this Shipwreck Cove for nothing.”]]></intro>

“Is that so?” [defender] inquired.

“Oh, aye,” Smeg replied. He adjusted his kilt and gave [pronoun2] a halfhearted smile. “Though I’m sure the captain can tell you more about that than I.”

There was something about the first mate’s statement that piqued [defender]’s curiosity. [Pronoun1] suddenly realized that Smeg, giant of a man that he was, might feel a little inferior to his captain.]]>

“Oh, aye,” Smeg replied. “I’ve ventured down under the blue from time to time as well.”

“Any advice?” [defender] asked.

The first mate mulled the question over. “The sea god strikes me as more than a bit glum. Mayhap comes from running an underwater empire. A lot of stress in that line of work.” Smeg gave a shrug of his broad shoulders. “ I always thought, a guy like that, might enjoy a joke. Something to take his mind off of the daily grind, you know?”

“He might, at that,” [defender] said, racking [pronoun3] brain for any good jokes. “Anything else?”

“If any of the sea creatures starts in about a password, it’s probably still barnacle. At least it was last I was down there.”

“Thank you, Smeg. That’s useful information.”

“Don’t mention it,” the first mate said, suddenly smiling. “Happy defending,” he added.]]>

They found Cleapeezious at the helm. The captain had cast down the anchor. In the distance was a tiny, uninhabited island. But the island was unimportant. What [defender] cared about was the cove beside it, and the god who was rumored to make his home beneath.

“This is it,” Cleapeezious said. The captain appeared a bit pale, tugging at her white hair nervously. “I dare not take the Stormin’ Norman in closer without fear of wrecking.]]>

			<![CDATA[The captain opened a trunk sitting to one side. “Then I guess you’ll be needing this,” she said, pulling out a tangle of diving gear. 

[defender] surveyed the gear. It consisted of a wetsuit, weight belt, air tanks, flippers, and diving helmet. [Pronoun1] ducked below deck to change, and came up a moment later wearing the wetsuit. 

Cleapeezious inspected [defender]’s suit with a satisfied nod.

[companion1]

“Once you get down the reef,” the captain said, “your guess is as good as mine as to where Morrissey will be holding court. I’d ask the first creature you find for directions, though they it may take some persistence. Lots of hustle and bustle out in the deeps, no time to help a stranger. You know how it goes. Just keep asking, eventually you’ll get there.”

“Thanks, captain,” [defender] replied. [Pronoun1] flapped over to the boat’s edge in [pronoun3] flippers, put [pronoun3] diving helmet on, and gave [companionName] a thumb’s up sign. “Ready?” [pronoun1] asked. [Pronoun3] voice sounded strange from within the helmet.

			<![CDATA[It took [defender] a moment to get [pronoun3] bearings once under water, but then [pronoun1] spotted [companionName] waving from down below, and [pronoun1] quickly followed.

A colorful reef raced down beside them, filled with fiery coral and blooming sea flowers. Small fish zipped in and out of the reef, and [defender] waved [pronoun3] hand, trying to get their attention. “Hello,” [pronoun1] called. “Excuse me.”

A clown fish paused to gape at them. “Hello,” it said. “What kind of fish are you?”

“I’m not a fish,” [defender] corrected. “I’m the Defender of the Realm.”

“Never heard of you,” the fish replied, and zipped away.

“Well that was rude,” [companionName] said.

[defender] and [companionName] both attempted to flag down a number of the reef’s occupants, but none paid them any mind. As they drifted further down the reef, the activity lessened, until finally, all of the fish seemed to flit away at once. [defender] looked around warily, wondering what could have caused them to scatter so quickly. From deep within the watery gloom, [pronoun1] could just make out a tiny orb of light bobbing in their direction.

“What is that?” [pronoun1] asked. [Pronoun3] companion remained silent on the subject, and [pronoun1] turned to see why [companionName] had gone quiet. The [companion] was gone. [Pronoun1] flipped back around and realized [pronoun3] companion had drifted toward the light, out of hearing range.

[defender] swam after the [companion] as the light grew brighter, and larger. Too late, [pronoun1] realized the kind of creature that was swimming toward them. “[companionName],” [pronoun1] screamed to [pronoun3] companion. 
“Stop!”]]>

			<![CDATA[The brightness blossomed, pushing through the water in a flood of white light. [defender] could just make out the silhouette of a fish, bigger than a whale. It opened its mouth to reveal long, spear-like teeth. A moment later, mighty jaws clamped down around [companionName]. The light flicked out, leaving only the swish of the fish’s tail visible as it retreated through the waves. 

[defender] stared, immobilized by horror. The retreating shape could be nothing other than a dungeonfish, and everyone agreed that there was no fate worse than being captured by the giant fish. Dungeonfish kept their captives alive for the first hour of imprisonment, behind the bars of their teeth, in order to suck their adrenalin. Once every drop of adrenalin had been consumed, the fish proceeded to suck the meat from their prisoner’s bones. [defender] shuddered. [Pronoun1] had to rescue [companionName], but if [pronoun1] chased after [companionName], would [pronoun1] still have time to find the sea god?]]>

[Pronoun1] didn’t have long before [pronoun1] felt a shadow block out the sunlight overhead. [Pronoun1] twisted [pronoun3] body just as the beast attacked, slicing its snout.

It veered off to one side, leaving a trail of blood as it twisted through the murky waves. A moment later it came for [pronoun2] again.

This time [pronoun1] slashed [pronoun3] dagger deeper into the shark’s snout. Blood poured forth from the wound, blooming red in the water.

[defender] waited for another attack. [Pronoun3] heartbeat pounded through [pronoun3] body, pulsing through the tips of [pronoun3] fingers as [pronoun1] clutched the hilt of [pronoun3] blade. [Pronoun1] used [pronoun3] flippers to turn in slow circles, waiting. Minutes passed until [pronoun1] was sure that the shark had gone in search for easier prey.
]]></weapon>
			<weapon><![CDATA[[Pronoun3] quill would do [pronoun2] no good underwater—there would be no drawing [pronoun3] way out of this situation. Instead, [pronoun1] balled [pronoun3] fingers into a tight fist and waited. [Pronoun1] felt a shadow block out the sun from overhead before [pronoun1] saw the shark. [Pronoun1] twisted [pronoun3] body just as the beast attacked. As the shark lunged toward [pronoun2], [pronoun1] rammed [pronoun3] fist into its snout. 

It veered off to one side, and twisted back through the murky waves, once again coming for [pronoun2].

This time [pronoun1] gave the shark’s snout a double punch. First a right hook, then a left.

[defender]’s heart beat in [pronoun3] throat as [pronoun1] waited for another attack. [Pronoun1] looked around, using [pronoun3] flippers to turn in a circle, then another, spinning like a top for another minute before [pronoun1] stopped. The shark was gone. No doubt it had gone in search of easier prey.
]]></weapon>
			<weapon><![CDATA[Luckily [pronoun1] had been saving a very special spell for just this sort of situation. It was a single use incantation of ancient power that created an opposite emotion. As the shark lunged toward [pronoun2], [pronoun1] yelled as loudly as [pronoun1] could, Lindania Olsenius Flim Flamingo!

The shark stopped itself with a flip of its fin. Its eyes, which had been menacing and cold and hungry a moment before somehow shifted, now shining with excitement. 

“You,” the shark said in a low, oily voice that would have been menacing if it hadn’t sounded so happy. “You look like…” The shark darted away, moments later returning with a tin can clenched between its powerful jaws.  “Like fun!” The shark spit the can into the water, did a back flip, and smacked the can with the tip of its tail toward [defender]. “Catch!”

[defender] obliged, catching the spiraling can with ease.

“Now throw it! And then I’ll bring it back!” the shark encouraged.

“I’m sorry, I don’t have time to play,” [defender] said. “I have to find that dungeonfish.” 

The shark stopped darting around in the water and sighed. “There’s no catching a dungeonfish once they have a captive. Even for me.” As if to prove the point, the shark darted through the water with breathtaking speed—up, down, around, and in a loop around [defender]. “I’m fast, but a dungeonfish is faster. So let’s play. Okay?” The shark gave [pronoun2] a hopeful look.]]></weapon>

“What is that?” [defender] asked the shark. 

“Oh, that’s just the jellies singing. They do that from time to time.” 

“The jellies?” [pronoun1] asked.

The shark nosed the tin can toward [defender] once again, ignoring [pronoun3] question. “Now can we play?”

“I must be on my way,” [defender] replied. “Though if you could tell me where I might find the sea god, I’d be most appreciative.”

The shark looked put out in the way that only an 8-foot tiger shark can. “Morrissey travels with the tides. Who can keep up?” He nodded politely before darting off into the blue.]]></weapon>

[Pronoun1] paused. The shape shot past [pronoun2] again. A fin protruded from its back.

[Pronoun1] swiveled, trying to find out where the creature had gone. This time it came closer, zipping toward [pronoun2] and deflecting at the last moment. The moment lasted long enough to see the pattern on its body. Tiger stripes. First the dungeonfish.]]>

[defender] looked in the direction of the dungeonfish, but the water was empty. There was no trace of the giant fish. [Pronoun3] only hope of rescuing [companionName] would be to find Morrissey. If anyone would know where [pronoun3] companion had been taken, it was the god of the sea. 

This thought was suddenly interrupted by a beautiful, haunting aria. The sound drifted through the water, surrounding [pronoun2] like a cocoon. [Pronoun1] paused wondering what the underwater music could be.[weapon2]]]>

The sea flowers and plants growing on the reef pulsed with the beat as [pronoun1] grew closer to the source of the music. As [pronoun1] rounded a bend, [pronoun1] narrowly avoided swimming right into dozens of sea horses. Each swam with a partner. Their tails intertwined as they circled in a dance to the music. As [pronoun1] swam even closer to the music, it seemed to somehow embrace [pronoun2].

Which is when [defender] realized that the embrace wasn’t metaphorical. [Pronoun1] was surrounded by a]]>

Another tentacle wound around [pronoun3] middle, squeezing the air from [pronoun3] lungs. [Pronoun1] screamed out in agony until [pronoun3] chest began to go numb. [Pronoun1] tried to kick [pronoun3] legs and escape the tentacles streaming around [pronoun2], but they no longer seemed to work. As [pronoun1] sank through the chorus of jellyfish, one thought filled [pronoun3] mind: regret at being unable to save [pronoun3] companion, and the realm. Had [pronoun1] only stayed focused on the task at hand…

Still, [pronoun1] thought, trying to remain positive in [pronoun3] final moments, at least [pronoun1] was going down with a nice soundtrack.

Soon enough, [defender] reached the bottom of the reef. [Pronoun3] flippers hit the sand, sending it swirling in all directions.

“Achoo,” [pronoun1] heard someone say.

“Bless you,” [pronoun1] said.

As the sand settled, [pronoun1] realized the sneeze had come from a small rock lobster near one of [pronoun3] flippers.

“Why hello there,” [pronoun1] said politely.

The lobster raised one claw in a salute. “Commodore Zachary Thacher, representing the subsurface fleet, first division, at your service.”  

“Nice to meet you,” [defender] said. “My name is [defender], Defender of the Realm. I have urgent business with Morrissey, the sea god. Could you point me in his direction, please?”]]>

The entire reef’s been walking on seashells ever since it happened.” The lobster lowered his voice conspiratorially. “It’s even worse than last year when his lucky dice went missing. I’m here to tell you it was a regular tempest in a teapot.”

“I’m afraid it can’t be helped,” [defender] replied. “I have urgent business with him. It concerns the realm. And a missing friend of mine.”

“Very well,” the commodore replied. “But first, I’ll need the password.”]]>

Sunken ships in various stages of decay stretched out over the ocean floor as far as [pronoun1] could see. Some were barely more than soggy mounds. 

Directly in front of them was the remains of a sailboat. A green, lightly scaled man slumped on one side of the boat. He was small in stature, with a bronze tail where a land dweller’s legs might have been. He thumped the side of the boat with his tail, while at the same time twirling a golden trident in his left hand. A milky pearl gleamed from the trident’s center. He looked up as they approached, fixing [defender] with a dour expression.

“May I present,” the rock lobster announced,]]>

			<![CDATA[“Commodore,” the green man said. The word came out as a long sigh, and he turned his gaze toward [defender], fixing [pronoun2] with mossy green eyes. He certainly didn’t seem great and powerful. If anything, he seemed in desperate need of cheering up, thought [defender]. “You must be the realm’s latest Defender,” Morrissey continued. “There’s been a slew of you hero types of late. Not sure why any of you bother, really. Nero is unstoppable.”

[defender] stiffened at Morrissey’s words. “It’s a pleasure to meet you,” [defender] said. “Sir,” [pronoun1] tacked on, unsure of what kind of honorific one used when dealing with a sea god. “But frankly,” [pronoun1] added, “with an attitude like that, of course Nero will do what he likes. Perhaps you’ve heard the phrase mind over matter? You might consider trying it some time.”

“Mind over matter is all well and good when luck is going your way,” the sea god replied, annoyance plain in his tone. He slipped off of his perch and swam toward them, never breaking the rhythm of his spinning trident. He stopped when he was five feet from [defender]. He was even smaller than he had seemed from a distance, the top of his head only reaching [defender]’s shoulder. His skin gleamed. “But I’ve misplaced my luck,” Morrissey continued.“Until it’s returned, I want to be alone. Is that too much to ask?”

“I’m afraid it is,” [defender] replied. “I believe we can save the realm. If you’ll simply hear me out?”

Morrissey glared, but didn’t interrupt as defender] began to speak.  

[defender] wasted no time in explaining [pronoun3] mission. [Pronoun1] told the sea god of [companionName]’s capture, and of [pronoun3] quest thus far, highlighting a few minor successes. [Pronoun1] concluded by explaining [pronoun3] need for the pearl and how [pronoun1] would use it to defeat Prince Nero. And [pronoun1] did it all in 90 seconds flat. After all, [pronoun1] had a schedule to keep.

The sea god’s mossy eyes never blinked as [defender] spoke. When the tale was concluded, he simply shrugged his narrow shoulders. “I don’t see how this is my problem,” he said.

“I think you’ve somehow misunderstood,” [defender] said, urgency creeping into [pronoun3] tone. “You’re in grave danger. As is the entire realm.” [Pronoun1] paused, fixing Morrissey with a serious look. “As is my companion. Surely you can understand that, if nothing else?”

Morrissey stopped spinning his trident and plunged it into the sandy floor beneath them. “Enough,” he said. “I am in ill humor, and this conversation does nothing to inspire me to action.” The sea god turned to the rock lobster. “Commodore, please escort the Defender back to the reef. Until my luck changes, I’m not in the mood for interruptions.”

“Yes, sir,” the rock lobster replied with a crisp salute. He turned to [defender] and lowered his voice. “Told you so,” he said matter-of-factly.  

[defender] watched as Morrissey bowed his head and turned from them, drifting back toward the sunken boat. “Wait,” [pronoun1] called.

The sea god paused, his back still turned, as [defender] considered [pronoun3] next move. [Pronoun1] wasn’t about to let [pronoun3] companion become a dungeonfish’s meal, and the realm certainly didn’t have time for a sullen sea god. There were really just two possible courses of action.]]>

Morrissey straightened, turning around with sudden interest. A smile stretched over his green lips, revealing fangs. For a moment he looked more shark than man. His fist tightened around his trident.]]>

“Then let us shake on it,” [defender] said, pressing [pronoun3] advantage.

Morrissey gave [pronoun2] a speculative look, but finally nodded his head slowly. “Very well,” he said, stretching out his hand. He clasped [defender]’s hand in his. Despite the sea god’s small stature, [defender] could feel [pronoun3] bones being crushed. 

“Listen carefully, for I’ll not say it again,” Morrissey instructed. “Commodore Thacher will escort you beyond the reef to the edge of my lands. There you will find a ravine of jellyfish. Below this, the jellied devils hold my starfish in plain sight, taunting me. Retrieve it for me, and I’ll owe you a favor of your choice.”

“And by favor,” [defender] began, “do you mean…”

“Commodore,” the sea god’s voice boomed. “See that the Defender reaches the reef.”

“Yes, sir,” the rock lobster replied smartly. “Right this way,” he said.

[defender] gave the sea god one last searching look. [Pronoun1] couldn’t help feeling like [pronoun1]’d been tricked. Still, time was running out for [companionName]. The [companion] needed [pronoun3] help. [Pronoun1] hurried after the lobster, intent on [pronoun3] mission.]]>

“You’ve got gumption,” Morrissey conceded. “I can appreciate that. I’ll make you a deal. I’ve of late lost my lucky starfish to a group of roving jellyfish.

Five minutes passed before the commodore stopped. They stood together, looking over an underwater cliff. It was dark below, but [defender] could hear the faint sound of singing. It was the same [pronoun1] had heard on [pronoun3] way down the reef. 

“What is it?” [pronoun1] asked in hushed tones. There was a haunting quality to the song that made [pronoun2] want to whisper.]]>

At least there’s that.”

[defender] hung the pendent around [pronoun3] neck. It glowed softly. “Thank you, commodore,” [pronoun1] said before stepping off the reef.]]>

“Well?” he said, struggling to keep the excitement from his face.

[defender] reached into [pronoun3] pocket and pulled the starfish out with a flourish. “I believe we had an agreement,” [pronoun1] reminded the sea god.

“Yes, yes, very well,” Morrissey replied. “Name your favor.”

Your companion, or my pearl—on loan, of course. With the pearl, the secrets of the ocean will be yours to command. No small feat, I’m sure you’ll agree.” Morrissey spun his trident lazily, but [defender] could see by the clenching of his jaw that he was impatient. “Now go on,” Morrissey continued, suddenly cross. “Make a decision.

“Interesting decision,” was all the sea god said before dislodging the pearl from his trident, placing it into [defender]’s outstretched hand, and disappearing in a poof of billowing sand.

Left alone with [pronoun3] thoughts, [defender] couldn’t help thinking of poor [companionName], left alone behind the dungeonfish’s barred teeth. It was a horrible fate, but wasn’t this sacrifice worth it? After all, the pearl was vital if [pronoun1] was going to save the realm from Nero. 

A tear squeezed from [defender]’s eye, and then another, and another, mixing with the pressing salt water. A sudden vision of [companionName] sprung into [pronoun3] mind, and [pronoun1] gasped with the sudden horror of what would soon occur. [Pronoun1] simply couldn’t leave the [companion] to [companionPronoun3] fate. It was unthinkable. Unconscionable, even! It occurred to [pronoun2] that when a decision felt this wrong, it probably was. [Pronoun1] had to find Morrissey while there was still time.

After wheedling, cajoling, and even some half-hearted begging, Morrissey finally agreed to part with his pearl. From there it was a quick trip back to the surface of the ocean. Smeg was on watch as they reached the top, and threw a rope down for them to climb up.

“Congratulations,” the first mate said, pounding [defender] on the back. 

“I couldn’t have done it without that password,” [defender] replied. 

“It worked, did it?” Smeg asked, looking pleased. “Glad to have helped.”]]>

“Now that you have the pearl,” she said, “we’ll be able to track Nero’s island as it moves through the water. Well done, Defender.”

[defender] grinned, relishing the captain’s praise.]]>

As the captain set sail for the Sandlands, [defender] and [companionName] regaled the crew with the details of their trip with Snowmonch. ”She’s really a very nice serpent,” [defender] concluded [pronoun3] story. “Just misunderstood, like a lot of people.” 

[Pronoun3] audience was quietly thoughtful as [defender] and [companionName] stood. “And now,” [pronoun1] said, “we must rest. Tomorrow we will find the wizard, and we’ll need our wits about us.”]]></intro>

Defender looked at [pronoun3] [weapon] wearily. The [stone1] [pronoun1] had collected so far gleamed. [Pronoun1] tucked [pronoun3] [weapon] back into [pronoun3] [wardrobeShort] and lay back into [pronoun3] hammock. The next stop would be the Sandlands.

			<![CDATA[There could be no rest until all of the stones were collected, and so it was with a heavy heart that [defender] thanked the crew for their offer of a celebration, and instead selected the next island. Despite some good-natured rumbling, the crew raised anchor to set sail for the Sandlands. Exhausted after [pronoun3] time with the cats, [defender] promptly fell into a deep sleep. [intro1]

[defender] woke with the rising sun to see an island far out on the port side of the Stormin’ Norman. The island looked brown, dead, and rocky, even from a distance. [Pronoun1] felt [pronoun3] stomach sinking. These were the desolate Sandlands, home to the famous recluse, the Wizard Maysel. Few had made the hermit’s acquaintance, and of those, fewer had returned in their original form. The wizard would do almost anything to maintain his separation from those who sought his counsel, and [defender] only hoped [pronoun1] could find him. If [pronoun1] found him, [pronoun1] only hoped he would listen.

[Pronoun1] pushed [pronoun3] fears down and turned to [companionName]. “Well,” [pronoun1] said, trying [pronoun3] best to sound cheerful, “it looks like we’re almost there. Let’s go find the captain and be on our way.”]]>

			<![CDATA[[defender] and [companionName] found Cleapeezious at the helm of the ship. The captain had dropped anchor a distance from the shore of the Sandlands and eyed the island skeptically. She turned as [defender] approached.

“I always thought the Sandlands might make a nice spot for a summer home,” the captain said, nodding toward the barren, rocky shore. 

“Indeed,” [defender] said, noticing a swarm of cawing birds flying over the island. “If you like sand, ravens, and roving wizards.”

Cleapeezious snorted as she motioned toward the dingy strapped to the side of the ship. “And swamps,” the captain added, moving ropes around to make room for [defender] and [companionName] to climb into the dingy. “You can’t forget the swamps.” 

The two stood eyeing the island in silence. [defender] felt [pronoun3] pulse quicken as [pronoun1] considered [pronoun3] quest. “Any advice before we go?” [defender] asked hopefully.

The captain shrugged. “The waters should be safe around these parts. It’s the island dwellers you’ll want to be wary of. They’re a tricky lot.”

With that, [defender] and [companionName] climbed into the dingy, the crew lowered them down into the waves, and they were off.  Ten minutes later they reached the shore.

They looked around, taking in the new island from up close. It was a desolate beach, barren of any life, save a few gnarled shrubs struggling to survive. Two distinct paths lead from the shore—one wound its way up through the rocky dunes toward a craggy hilltop. The other lead straight from the beach, into what appeared to be a swamp. [Pronoun1] could hear flies buzzing even from where [pronoun1] stood.

As [defender] was trying to decide on a direction, two ravens flew down, landing next to [pronoun3] feet.]]>

“Flee,” the smaller agreed.

“Beware the wizard,” the first intoned. 

The smaller raven concluded the warning with a sneer.]]>

			<![CDATA[“I see,” [defender] replied. “And you are?” [pronoun1] continued pleasantly.

The larger raven puffed up his chest. “I’m Zane,” he said. He nodded his feathered head toward the other raven. “And that’s my sister, Zara.”

“It’s a pleasure to meet you,” [defender] said. “I am [defender] and this is [companionName] and we don’t exactly have an invitation, but we’d really like to talk to the wizard. Would you be so kind as to point us in his general direction?”

“Huh,” Zane says. “What do you think, Zara?”

The birds conferred in a series of low squawks until a verdict was reached. The smaller of the two, Zara, hopped toward them. “If you take the winding path, you’ll get there eventually,” she offered.

“Though,” Zane added, “the straight path is much quicker.” He looked at his sister and the two began to cackle as only ravens can. 

There was something disturbing about the laughter, but [defender] did need to hurry. “What do you think?” [pronoun1] asked [pronoun3] companion.

[companion1]

This made the ravens laugh even louder, and they flew away, cawing as they swept into the empty blue sky. They circled overhead, watching. It would be up to [defender] to set the course. [Pronoun1] eyed the larger raven with suspicion as he drifted on the breeze. [Pronoun1] couldn’t shake a deep sense of mistrust, though [pronoun1] was unable to put [pronoun3] finger on it.]]>

They’d taken no more than three steps before [defender] felt [pronoun2]self sinking. [Pronoun1] struggled, trying to free [pronoun2]self, but seconds later [pronoun1] had sunk up to [pronoun3] waist in liquid sand. [companionName] struggled beside [pronoun2].

The ravens flew overhead, now cawing and laughing. The larger of the two dove down, landing on a boulder just out of [defender]’s reach. “I did say it would be quick,” Zane said. “Get it?” he cawed.]]>

“Wait,” [defender] called, struggling in vain against the sand. The ravens just laughed as they flew out of sight.

Perhaps, [defender] thought as [pronoun1] felt the sand circle [pronoun3] throat, [pronoun1] shouldn’t have been in such a rush, and trusted [pronoun3] instincts instead. Now [pronoun1] would never know where the winding path lead, and the realm would plunge into darkness without [pronoun3] assistance, for this was most certainly…

			<![CDATA[The more time that [defender] spent in the defense business, the more [pronoun1] had grown to trust [pronoun3] instincts. Which is why [pronoun1] ignored the quicker, straighter path. Instead, [pronoun1] and [companionName] took off down the winding pathway, curving around dune after sandy dune. The heat was relentless and [defender] paused to occasionally take a drink of [beverage]. 

They’d gone on like this for some time when they finally reached a small hut. Tufts of loose thatch stuck up wildly from the rooftop and two shuttered windows flanked a wooden door. 

Despite the sign, defender walked up to the door and rapped [pronoun3] knuckles against the wood.]]>

			<![CDATA[[Pronoun1] could hear the sound of shuffling from within, and several deadbolts being slid open. Then the door creaked open and a boy, younger than [pronoun2] by a few years, poked his head out. He wore a wilted wizard hat covered in moons and stars. A smattering of freckles covered his nose and cheeks and he chewed a piece of gum with fierce determination.

[defender] cleared [pronoun3] throat. A small boy was not who [pronoun1] had been expecting, but [pronoun1] gave a winning smile all the same. “I am [defender] and this is [companionName] and we are here to speak to the great and powerful Wizard Maysel.” 

“He’s out right now,” the boy answered. He blew a large, pink bubble until it burst, coating his nose and cheeks. The boy peeled the gum from his face and shoved it back into his mouth.]]>

“Not for another hour. Maybe longer.” You never can tell when it comes to wizards,” the boy said. “Know what I mean?”

[companion1]

The boy opened the door wider, and [defender] could see a small fire burning, with a cauldron steaming above it. Several beakers and test tubes were scattered next to it, along with a canister of fluorescent goo.

“Tell you what,” the boy said, smacking his gum thoughtfully.]]>

The boy leaned against the doorframe, slowly blowing another bubble. This one was almost the size of his head when it burst.

“Or you’re welcome to come in and wait instead,” he said, scooping the gum from his face and squishing it back into his mouth. “What’ll it be?”

[defender] stood to one side, shifting back and forth on [pronoun3] feet as [pronoun1] waited.

And waited.

And waited.

Hours went by, then days. Occasionally [defender] would interrupt the apprentice’s work, asking the boy when the wizard might return. His answer was always the same.

“By and by,” he would say. 

After a week passed, [defender] and [companionName] admitted defeat. The wizard was not going to return. Perhaps he’d defected to another realm. It was the only explanation that [defender] could come up with, because without the sandstone, there would be no future in this realm.]]>

What’s important to remember about Gannon Sand is that the topsand isn’t good for potions. You have to dig down to no more, and no less than five feet.”

“Very well,” [defender] replied. “And what is Wilder Water?” [pronoun1] asked, pointing to the second item on the list.

“That’s easy,” the apprentice said. He handed [defender] an eyedropper and a beaker. “If you take the path behind the hut further down the hill and into the swamp, you’ll find the Wilder Well. You’ll need to add 572 ½ drops in the beaker, which will put the water near this fill line.” He tapped his finger to a red line on the beaker.

“Sounds easy enough,” [defender] replied. 

“Oh it is, it is,” the apprentice said, escorting [defender] and [companionName] back to the door. “But it’s very important to follow the instructions exactly, so don’t rush.]]>

[companion1]

They continued down the path until eventually it lead them to a crumbling well. The rocks, which formed its base, were covered in green slime, and had begun to spread over the sign which hung there. It read: “Wilder Well.” A bucket hung from a thick piece of rope over the side of the well. [defender] lowered the rope, scooped the water below with the bucket, and raised it to set on the side of the well. [Pronoun1] pulled out [pronoun3] eyedropper and beaker, then turned to [pronoun3] companion.

“I know the boy wanted us to use the eyedropper to fill the beaker,” [defender] said, “but I wonder why he would want to do that when I can just dip the beaker in the water to the fill line. Counting 572 ½ drops seems like a waste of time, if you ask me.

“Hmph,” was Oonie’s reply to that.]]></companion>
			<companion><![CDATA[“Well played, Defender,” Linus said, scrambling up onto the lip of the well and glaring after the birds. “Ravens ssssstir up trouble wherever they go. Bessssst not to trust them. And anyway, they’re lazy.”

[defender] looked at the lizard incredulously. 

“Oh yesssss,” he said, misinterpreting [defender]’s look as agreement. “Alwayssss lollygagging about.”

[defender] just shook [pronoun3] head in disbelief. Linus was certainly one to talk.]]></companion>
			<companion><![CDATA[Noah popped his head out of the tank and looked in the direction the birds had flown. “You made the right decision,” he said. “Those birds are up to no good, or my name’s not…” he scrunched up his face in confusion. “Wait, what’s my name again?”

[defender] looked at him in disbelief. “Seriously?” [pronoun1] asked.

Noah grinned, and used his tail to splash water into [defender]’s face. “Fooled you,” he yelled triumphantly. “My name is Noah and you couldn’t pay me enough to trust a raven.”]]></companion>

[companionName] gave [pronoun2] a disapproving look, but remained silent.

[defender] worked [pronoun3] way through the swamp, occasionally catching a look of what appeared to be a wizard hat in the distance. It took hours of searching before [pronoun1] finally gave up and decided that perhaps the hat had been a trick of the sunlight. It took several more hours to find [pronoun3] way back to the well. By then the horizon was splashed in pink and orange and [defender] remembered the apprentice’s request to be back by sunset. 

[Pronoun1] and [companionName] scrambled back in the direction of the hut. Right as they reached the clearing, the sun dipped below the horizon. The hut was gone. In its place stood a tall marble pole the size of a tree trunk. It was perfectly smooth to the touch. A man’s face had been sculpted into the top with lips pursed in irritation.

[defender] jumped when the lips moved.]]>

The face sneered down at [pronoun2]. “Typical tourist.” 

[defender] ignored the slight, instead giving the pole a respectful nod. “My name is [defender] and this is [companionName] and we are delighted to make your acquaintance.”

The face looked taken aback by [defender]’s greeting. “And I am the Milo de Milo,” he announced grandly. Seeing [defender]’s blank look, he added, “you know, cousin to the Venus de Milo. Twice removed.”

“I see,” [defender] said, although [pronoun1] didn’t really. “Sir Milo de Milo,” [pronoun1] began.

The pole swelled with pride at the sound of his name.

“I am looking for the great and powerful wizard, Maysel,” [pronoun1] continued. “His hut was here earlier today.”

The face rearranged to form an apologetic look. “A piece of advice,” he said. “When dealing with wizards, or Hellenistic sculptors, it’s important to be timely and heed instructions. The wizard left at sunset. He’ll be back this time next year.”

“But I don’t have until next year,” defender replied.

“Well then, I’d say this would be,” the face paused, relishing the drama of it all…

			<![CDATA[They found the path behind the wizard’s hut, and [defender] and [companionName] followed it up the hill, beyond the dunes, and to a large pit of sand. A sign hung next to it that read: Gannon Sand, please dig with caution.

“I guess this is it,” [defender] said, and dropped down to [pronoun3] knees, pulling the shovel, tape measure, and pail out to set to one side. With that, [pronoun1] began to dig.]]>

[defender] rolled [pronoun3] eyes, but continued to dig.

At three feet in, [defender] began to unearth some small rocks. It was on one of these that [defender] hit [pronoun3] shovel with such force that the handle fell right off.

“Oh no,” [defender] said. [Pronoun1] could feel tiny rivulets of sweat pouring down the sides of [pronoun3] face, and [pronoun1] wiped them away. “This will take twice as long now.”

“Keep it up,” [companionName] called.

But [defender], rather than keeping anything up, paused to sit down on the edge of the pit. It occurred to [pronoun2] that three feet and five feet were practically the same thing. After all, the apprentice had said the “topsand” should be avoided. Perhaps [pronoun1] could fill the bucket right here.]]>

[Pronoun1] scooped sand into the bucket, and patted it down smoothly at the top. There was simply no difference between sand at the three foot level, or deeper.

“You make a very nice daisy,” Maysel complimented [pronoun2]. The wizard then proceeded to scoop [defender] up, and pot [pronoun2] in the window flower box, where [pronoun1] remained to silently watch the sun rise, and set, until one day, there was no sunlight left.]]></intro>
			<intro id="waterWrong"><![CDATA[As soon as the drops hit the boiling water, they bounced right back out of the pot, and the bubbles turned a bruised shade of green. The boy turned to [defender], his lips pressed together in dismay. “You cheated,” he snapped. “Wilder water, as everyone knows, does not stay put unless an eye dropper is used. That is, of course, why it’s called Wilder Water. My potion is ruined because of you.”

The boy shook his head in disappointment. “You’re just like the rest of them. You don’t take me seriously because I look younger than my age. It’s not my fault I’ve got good genes,” he grumbled, pulling a wand from his belt. “It’s why I started telling people I was my own apprentice.

The boy—nay, the wizard Maysel—pointed his wand in [defender]’s direction, muttering a few words under his breath. The next thing [defender] knew a cloud of smoke billowed around [pronoun2]. A cloud of smoke filled the hut. When it cleared, [defender] looked down at [pronoun2]self.

“Welcome back,” he said with a broad smile. “The wizard hasn’t returned yet, so there’s still time to make the potion.” He looked at the bucket of sand pointedly.

			<![CDATA[“What?” [defender] and [companionName] both announced at once.

The boy nodded his head eagerly. “Oh yes,” he confirmed. “I’m Maysel. Everyone always misjudges me on account of how young I look, so over the years I’ve just pretended to be my own apprentice. Believe me, it’s easier. I’ve been asking visitors to fetch ingredients for me for years now, and no one ever does it the way I ask. It’s because they think I’m just an ignorant young boy.” The boy—nay, the wizard—shrugged his small shoulders. “They’ve all been great disappointments to me. But you two, why, perhaps you do have what it takes to save the realm.”

[defender] thanked the wizard for his kind words, and then took a deep breath. “Wizard Maysel, I’ve actually come to ask for a favor.”

The wizard interrupted him. “Yes, yes, you’re here for the sandstone, of course. Then off to battle Nero.”

[defender] pressed [pronoun3] lips together, impressed into silence.

Maysel adjusted his wizard’s hat in concentration. “If you can find it, it’s yours,” he said. “I know it’s somewhere in here, but for the life of me, I can’t remember where I put it.” He flashed a toothy grin. “I’ll give you, oh, 15 seconds. Ready?”]]>

Despite the knowledge the pearl had given [defender], and [pronoun3] newfound ability to track the Capitol, it was impossible to see anything in the darkness. The ship was soon lost. They drifted for weeks until one night (or perhaps it was day, it being difficult to judge such things when overwhelmed by endless darkness), [defender] heard an unmistakable crunch as the ship scraped something in the water. Moments later [pronoun1] felt a sickening lurch as the Stormin’ Norman tipped sideways. The crews’ panicked screams surrounded [pronoun2]. As the black seawater pulled the ship under, [pronoun1] couldn’t help but blame [pronoun2]self. Had [pronoun1] just been patient enough to collect all of the stones, this might not have happened.

			<intro><![CDATA[Cleapeezious was true to her word. With the aid of the pearl and cat’s eye, the Stormin’ Norman charted a course to the Capitol. Despite the island’s constant movement, the captain kept the ship a steady 100 yards from its shore. 

A black haze draped the island, bruising its rocky shore with a sickly purple light. From the center of the haze, a thin funnel of darkness and light sprang. It streaked through the air, spinning down toward the center of the island. From the ship, [defender] could just make out the silhouette of a castle. [Pronoun1] swallowed the fear rising in [pronoun3] throat and turned to [companionName].

“Well, I guess this is it,” [pronoun1] said, keeping [pronoun3] tone light.

But [pronoun1] couldn’t fool [pronoun3] companion. [companion1]

[defender] and [companionName] then went in search of Cleapeezious. She was naturally at the helm, and bade them good morning before getting down to strategy. “Take the dinghy from here,” she advised. “I’ll keep pace with the island until you return.”]]>

“How dare you drink all of the realm’s sunlight,” [defender] countered. “You should be ashamed of yourself. You’ve been a very bad prince. But there’s still time to redeem yourself.”

“Yeah yeah,” Nero replied, holding out one skinny arm. “Make me.” Sunlight poured from his open palm, oozing out over the rubble to create an army of terrifying, glowing creatures. They marched toward [defender] with vacant, lifeless eyes.

[defender] looked at him skeptically. “It’s not me who you should be asking, it’s the people of the realm.”

“I know, I know,” Nero said, climbing to his feet shakily. “And I will ask my loyal subjects for their forgiveness. I know it’s wrong to steal the sunlight, but you have to understand,]]>

[defender] felt a sudden pang of sadness for the prince. He looked so distraught. But it didn’t matter how sorry he was now, he had to answer for his crimes. “It’s too late for apologies,” [defender] said. “You should have taken control of your addiction. You had a realm to rule!” 

“It’s not my fault,” Nero said, abashed. “I want to stop, but I can’t kick the habit. You’d understand if you tried drinking sunlight too.” Nero pointed toward the overturned tank. “There’s still some left. If you’re as understanding as everyone says, you’d at least try and experience what I’ve been going through.”

[defender] paused, considering the prince’s words. It was true that sometimes when [pronoun1] put [pronoun2]self in other people’s shoes (golden, or otherwise), [pronoun1] gained a greater understanding of what they’d been going through. [Pronoun1]’d always prided [pronoun2]self on approaching [pronoun3] job with care and thoughtfulness. And yet here the prince was telling [pronoun2] that [pronoun1] couldn’t possibly understand. At the same time, common sense told [pronoun2] that sunlight in massive quantities was a dangerous substance, and not to be trifled with.

The prince seemed to sense [pronoun3] hesitation, and continued his plea with an encouraging smile. “It will make you a better Defender of the Realm,” he said smoothly. “You’ll have a greater capacity for empathy.”]]>

			<![CDATA[But [pronoun3] companion’s warning came too late, for [defender] was suddenly overcome with a sense of euphoria. [Pronoun3] senses felt enhanced. [Pronoun1] could hear the sound of [pronoun3] own heartbeat. [Pronoun1] could hear the sound of [companionName]’s heartbeat! A sense of such elation overcame [pronoun2] that [pronoun1] walked over to the prince and gave him a hug. 

“You were right,” [defender] told the prince. “I do understand now. But you were still in the wrong.”

“Have another drink,” the prince suggested.

[defender] could hear Nero’s heartbeat quicken as [pronoun1] gulped down more of the liquid sunlight. The warmth spread from [pronoun3] stomach to [pronoun3] fingertips and toes. [Pronoun1] was brimming with so much sunlight that [pronoun1] could barely contain [pronoun2]self, and suddenly, [pronoun3] enhanced senses were too much. [Pronoun1] could hear the fishes swimming in the ocean. [Pronoun1] could see a solitary raven flying miles and miles over the sea, and feel the breeze from its beating wings. The sunlight pressed against [pronoun2], stretching [pronoun3] skin until it felt too tight, as though [pronoun1] might pop. 

“What’s happening to me?” [pronoun1] whispered, cringing at the volume of [pronoun3] voice. It sounded like it had been broadcast through a speaker placed next to [pronoun3] ear.

Prince Nero shrugged. “Overdose, I suspect. A drink of concentrated sunlight is enough to drive anyone mad, even someone who has a tolerance for the stuff. I should know.” 

The prince laughed maniacally as [defender] fell to [pronoun3] knees, then toppled to one side. [Pronoun3] skin felt too tight, [pronoun3] throat as though it had been filled with sand. As [pronoun1] slipped into a bloated, coma-like state, [pronoun1] wondered why in the world [pronoun1] would have let the prince talk [pronoun2] into this. [Pronoun1] then succumbed to a dark void of nothingness.]]>

			<![CDATA[“I know, I know,” Nero said meekly. 

Before [defender] could respond, Nero sprung toward [pronoun2]. [Pronoun1] blocked and parried the prince’s attack, but was no match for him in hand-to-hand combat. The prince was still fueled with lingering sunlight, and his constant blows were unstoppable. [defender] took several steps back, beginning to worry.

[weapon1]

The prince pressed [defender] back until [pronoun1] was trapped against a wall. Just as Nero landed a particularly severe blow, a [previousDefenderGender] joined the battle, who looked close in age to [defender]. [Pronoun1] couldn’t help but notice how incredibly good looking [pronoun3] new ally was, and together, the two of them were able to wrestle Nero to the ground. 

“I’ve got him,” the stranger said. “I’ll hold him while you tie him up.” The [previousDefenderGender] flashed [defender] a wide smile, which [pronoun1] couldn’t help but return. 

“Thanks,” [defender] replied, quickly binding the prince’s wrists behind his back. 

“But, but, but,” Nero stuttered, before dissolving into inconsolable tears. 

The [previousDefenderGender] looked at the prince in disgust, and shook [previousDefenderPronoun3] head in disbelief. “He’s such a baby when he doesn’t get his way. It really makes negotiations tough, believe me.”

[defender] looked at the [previousDefenderGender] in confusion, but the stranger just laughed and held out [previousDefenderPronoun3] hand.

“I’m [previousDefender], the previous Defender of the Realm. Nero’s had me trapped in the dungeon for months now. I attempted to hold a civilized negotiation with him, and the next thing I knew, I woke up behind bars. I was freed when the walls of the castle turned to ash. How can I ever repay you?”

[defender] held out [pronoun3] own hand and shook the previous Defender’s hand. “How do you do,” [pronoun3] said. “I’m [defender], the current Defender of the Realm. I’m a big fan of your work.”

The [previousDefenderGender] blushed. 

“What do you say we get Nero back to the ship?” [defender] asked. “We could use your help. I’m sure the realm will be pleased to have you back.”

[previousDefender] nodded [previousDefenderPronoun3] head. “I’d be delighted,” [previousDefenderPronoun1] said, motioning for [defender] to lead the way.]]>

Sergeant Mikey came along as well, professing a keen interest in the Defending business. Once Nero was secured, and Cleapeezious cast off for the continent, [defender] and [previousDefender] spent the night immersed in pleasant conversation. [defender] was surprised to find out how many hobbies they had in common. [previousDefender] even shared [pronoun3] love of [beverage]. Before bed that night, the new friends toasted toward a happier realm now that Nero had been stopped. [defender] slept peacefully for the first time since [pronoun1]’d arrived to the realm.

Once they reached the continent, [defender] and [companionName] escorted Nero to a maximum-security rehabilitation facility specializing in sunlight addiction. Once this task was completed, the high council designated [pronoun3] defense of the realm a rousing success, and [pronoun1] was given a commemorative plaque of thanks. 

That night, Cleapeeazious threw a celebratory party on the Stormin’ Norman unlike anything [defender] had experienced. [defender] sang and played [pronoun3] [instrument] and took a turn dancing with several of the crewmembers, eventually finding [pronoun2]self partnered with [previousDefender] more and more throughout the night. [Pronoun1] was surprised when the captain finally bade them a goodnight. As the captain turned in for the night, [defender] and [previousDefender] found themselves alone, under a star-filled sky.

“What a fun night,” [defender] said happily. “I’m glad you were here too.” Suddenly [pronoun1] felt a twinge of sadness. [Pronoun1] wondered if [pronoun1]’d see [previousDefender] again after they anchored again tomorrow. [Pronoun1]’d grown fond of [previousDefenderPronoun2]. 

A moment later, [previousDefender] took [pronoun3] hands in [previousDefenderPronoun3] own. [PreviousDefenderPronoun1] looked at [defender] hopefully and cleared [previousDefenderPronoun3] throat before saying,]]>

Although [previousDefender] seemed like someone [pronoun1] wanted to know better, it was hard to trust someone so quickly. After all, [previousDefender] was from another realm. And [defender] really missed [pronoun3] own home. Particularly [pronoun3] dear friend, [contact]. 

In addition, after [pronoun3] recent success as a Defender, [defender] really wanted to focus on [pronoun3] career. Now that [pronoun1]’d succeeded in saving the realm, job offers were pouring in. A new world of opportunity had just burst open, and [defender] wanted to experience it all. 

Which is why [pronoun1] told [previousDefender] kindly, but firmly, that [pronoun1] needed some time to focus on [pronoun3] own affairs. [previousDefender] respected [defender]’s feelings, but asked if [previousDefenderPronoun1] might visit [pronoun2] in [pronoun3] own realm after [pronoun1]’d had a chance to see [pronoun3] friends and family.

There was something about the previous Defender that made [pronoun2] feel anxious and happy and excited all at the same time. [Pronoun1] was determined to get to the bottom of it, and so [pronoun1] did as [previousDefender] suggested, and invited [previousDefenderPronoun2] for a visit.

[Pronoun1] spent the first week alone in [pronoun3] home realm, seeing friends and family and catching up on all that had happened since [pronoun1]’d been called for duty. By the end of the first day [pronoun1] was so tired of recounting [pronoun3] adventures that [contact] quickly typed up [pronoun3] story and handed it out to anyone wanting details. ]]>

A week later, [previousDefender] joined [pronoun2]. [defender] was shocked to see how perfectly the previous Defender fit in with [pronoun3] friends. Even better, [previousDefenderPronoun1] and [contact] struck up an immediate friendship. The three could often be found laughing loudly together, sharing a canteen of [beverage]. 

[defender] and [previousDefender] soon grew quite close, finishing each other’s sentences and finding even more unlikely similarities. The previous Defender had an even larger collection of [weapon1] as well as wonderful stories of [previousDefenderPronoun3] own time spent in the defense business. In fact, the two got on so well that they decided to go into business together. [contact] managed their contracts, [companionName] stayed on as a trusted consultant, and Sergeant Mikey joined them for missions requiring an extra pair of hands. When things got really tough, the wizard Maysel prepared them a custom potion guaranteed to vanquish foes, big and small. Together, their group was unstoppable, freeing realm after realm from corruption, tyranny, and evil. Life was happy. 

That is until [previousDefender] was captured by intergalactic space pirates and spirited off to another dimension. But that, as they say, is an entirely different story.

After pouring through a flood of opportunities, [defender] found [pronoun2]self gravitating toward one in particular. The political party known as the METS (Monkeys for the Ethical Treatment of Sunlight) nominated [pronoun2] to become the next Prince of the Realm.

After a grueling campaign, the ballots were cast. [defender] won by a landslide. [Pronoun3] first act as prince was to set up an advisory council, and [pronoun1] brought together the smartest people and creatures [pronoun1] knew. [companionName] joined first, followed by Snowmonch and Maysel. [Pronoun1] then hired on Sergeant Mikey Lewis for advice on military strategy. Even [contact] lent a hand, focusing on interrealm peace. 

The realm flourished under [defender]’s care, and its denizens enjoyed peace and prosperity unlike anything they had known. [defender] spent [pronoun3] days resolving disputes and finding efficiencies where there had once been none. [Pronoun1] flourished under the challenges of leadership, becoming quite famous for [pronoun3] wisdom and bravery. In fact, everyone was well on their way to living happily ever after. 

That is until a band of unruly intergalactic space pirates created a very big commotion. But that, as they say, is an entirely different story. ]]>
